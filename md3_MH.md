### Physical health assessment

- Major mental illness increases risk for medical conditions and risk for premature death from physical morbidity
- Screen, assess and facilitate treatment re. physical comorbidity for pts with mental illness

Reviewing a patient:
- Physical health history incl. substance use and medical complications of this
- Family history of physical health problems
  + Beware prescribing meds which increase risk of diabetes or CVD complications
- Physical exam
  + CVD exam
  + Respiratory exam
- Routine investigations at baseline and again at intervals in metabolic monitoring guidelines
  + FBE, UEC, LFT, TFT, fasting lipids and glucose, prolactin levels, vitamin D, vit B12, ECG
  + Intervals more frequent if clinically indicated eg weight gain or medication changes

Patients on __clozapine__:
- Increased risk of __neutropenia__ and __myocarditis__
  + Most risk in first 18 weeks of treatment
  + Symptoms can be nonspecific flu-like symptoms
  + FBE and ECG
- Increased risk of __constipation__ leading to __bowel obstruction__
  + Mortality risk of bowel perforation
  + Prescribe aperients
  + Practice GI exam

### History of Psychiatry

- Distinction between history and memory
  + Be critical and discerning of different histories
  + ‘History’ often written by clinicians not historians – returning to primary sources can be fun and informative
  + Are you being sold a line
- Association between history and identity
- Multiple histories of and histories within psychiatry
  + Mythologisation of Philippe Pinel after his death
  + Influential as medical classifier in his lifetime, 1745 to 1826
  + Standing diminished after his death to be revived as a mythical figurehead of the profession of psychiatry – 1849 he is painted by Muller, ordering the striking of chains from a madman (commissioned by…who?); 1878 a Fleury painting; Durand statue in 1885.
  + Foucault, who portrays Pinel in dark tones, as the instigator of a disease centred (cf person centred) exploitative ideological enterprise underpinning modern psychiatry. Read ‘History of Madness’ for more.
  + “According to Foucault, under the guise of an enlightened, humane, medical and scientific management of madness, a new regime of control, surveillance and psychological unfreedom is ushered in” – Mike Salzberg, C-L head at SVHA
- ‘Triangle of reference’, __the semiotic triangle = words, concepts, reality__
  + In context of the collective history of mental disorders: connections between psych terms, psych concepts of disorder, and occurrences of mental or behavioural disturbance in the real world.
- Neurosis
  + Cullen’s nosology was v influential in the 18th C. Four classifications of illnesses generally: pyrexiae, neurosiae, cachexiae, localae
  + Included in neurosiae were any disorders affecting the nervous system generally. Elevates the brain to a central role in all disorders.
  + Notable neuroses which were lost by the end of the 19th C: epilepsy (--> neurology), insanity (--> psychosis --> psychiatry), and hysteria (abandoned). Sometimes an organic cause/lesion was found (e.g. syphilis)
  + The word “neurosis” is picked up by psychoanalysis
  + Reacting to this, DSM-III proposed to remove neurosis as a diagnostic concept >> psychoanalysts mobilised against this because most of what they were treating (in spas, private practise) were the neuroses
- Neuroculture
  + ‘Brainhood, anthropological figure of modernity’ – Fernando Vidal 2009
  + George S Rousseau started thinking about brain based thinking – traced it to Thomas Willis, 1680 anatomist; Cheyne, a nerve doctor; Samuel Richardson, writer. Griesinger links growth of arts and sciences to an increase in cerebral activity in 1861. In 1870s-1880s we thought we were going to solve the mystery of the insanities (similar excitement to that happening in neuroscience now) – then a collapse, failure after failure, then the rise of psychoanalysis, experimental psychology, retreat back to the bedside.
  + RDoC vs DSM-ICD

## The MSE and The Interview

### Philosophical Waffle

- Cartesian doubt: in his Discours de la méthode 1637, Descartes (1596-1650) resolved to doubt everything he could (absolute scepticism)
- Kant: __object__ (content/sensation) + subjective apparatus __ordering__ the phenomenon (form)
- Husserl: Phenomenological method
- Karl Jaspers: General Psychopathology first published 1913.
  + Entering into the mental life of patients <==> empathy.
  + Emphasis on the form of a delusion (how the subject orders the experience), rather than their content
  + Critical of psychoanalysis (?focus on content)
- The MSE is driven by curiosity and play – what can you find out?

### Reporting the MSE

When reporting, comment on appearance and behaviour, speech, mood, affect, thought, perception, cognition, insight and judgement.

The MSE describes the patient at the time of interview. Not before (history), nor in the context of their life (formulation)

__Appearance and behaviour__: the person reading the MSE should be able to pick your patient in a crowd.
- __Physical appearance__: gender; ethnicity; body habitus; gait on entry; posture on sitting; apparent age; cleanliness and grooming; hair or clothing style; facial hair; cosmetics; piercings; jewellery; syndromic features; tattoos
  + Older than stated age: chronic psychosis; younger than stated age:
  + Body habitus: eating disorders
  + Grooming: dishevelled if depressed or psychotic; makeup more garish or absent cf. baseline
  + Clothing: common for pts in chronic psychosis to dress for the wrong season (wearing many layers in summer)
  + Dehydrated: oral intake can slip in some of these patients
- __Manner__ relating to clinician and parents: ease of separation from each parent; reactions to meeting clinician (eager to please, defiant, over-familiar); eye contact; facial expression. Note presence of hallucinatory behaviours (talking to self, incongruent laughter)
  + Overfamiliar: mania, PDs
  + Seductive: mania, PDs
  + Aggressive: important for risk
  + Eye contact: are they looking at things you can’t see? Intense, unbroken – antisocial or psychotic.
  + Rapport: indicates how well they might engage in treatment. Superficial?
  + Guarded: avoid answering questions in detail
- __Activity level__: psychomotor slowing or agitation (sustained or episodic, goal-oriented or erratic); coordination, unusual posturing or motor patterns (e.g. tics, stereotypies, odd mannerisms, tremors)
  + ‘Psychiatric pillow’ if they have a particularly rigid
  + Agitated depression distinguish from melancholic depression
  + Stereotypies and mannerisms are repeating the same movement over and over again; stereotypies are purposeless, mannerisms are purposeful
  + Tardive dyskinesia: one of the scariest side effects of first generation antipsychotic medications

__Speech__: form of the speech. Spontaneous and talkative to mute.
- Fluency; rate; volume; prosody (monotone or variable); “pressured speech”; dysarthria (difficult or unclear articulation of speech); dysphasia (level of receptive understanding and ability to express oneself); verbigeration (repeating same word/s)
  + Clanging in mania; neologisms in psychosis
  + Pressure of speech – interruptible or not? Mania.
  + Latency: take seconds to respond. Psychotic or hallucinating.

__Emotion__: mood + affect.
- Mood: predominant emotion over past days/weeks (euthymic, low, apathetic, angry, dysphoric, apprehensive, euphoric). Rate 0 – extremely sad and wishing life end immediately to 10 – extremely happy.
- Affect: current observable emotional state. Describe quality, intensity, dynamics (range (constricted to labile), reactivity (blunted to flat to reactive)), congruence (appropriateness to mood) and communication.
  + Frequently >1 affect; qualify intensity of each (moderate anger, marked euphoria, intense sadness).
  + Perplexed – bewildered (psychotic), puzzled (think organic/psychotic).
  + Fatuous – vacant, silly, superficial, oft incongruent with thought/situation (think psychotic).
  + Dysphoric (sad)
  + Bright.
  + Irritable
  + Range = diversity of affective states the pt mounts in response to emotionally laden topics. Reduced in organic, psychotic and affective disorders.
  + Labile (rapid sadness to euphoria), irritable (rapid escalation to anger), in mania.
  + Flatness = limited range (think depression, anergia in schizophrenia).
  + Blunted = numbness, insensitivity to social context, emotional detachment (think psychotic, one of the negative sx of chronic schizophrenia).
  + NB American literature considers blunting to be emotion on a reduced spectrum of intensity vs flattening which is a complete lack of emotional range.
- Is the mood congruent to the affect? Think psychotic if not; personality disorders also have
- Communication: experiencing elements of a patient’s affect. Schizophrenia --> “pane of glass” effect (non-communication of affect) can be diagnostic.

__3 Thought__: stream, form, and content.
- Stream: poverty of thought (blocking), poverty of content (verbigeration or perseveration), racing thoughts, flight of ideas
- Form: Normal thought form is logical & goal-directed.
  + Disordered: circumstantial, tangential, derailment, loose associations, word salad. Flight of ideas = tangential thoughts all strung together quickly.
  + Perseveration = giving the same answer to many different questions. Normally seen in organic conditions – delirium, dementia

![Disorders of thought form 1](../blob/main/TLC_1.png)
![Disorders of thought form 2](https://github.com/wollemia/md/blob/main/TLC_2.png)

- Content: __obsessions/preoccupations, delusions*__ (e.g. persecutory, referential, grandiose, somatic, bizarre), phobias, magical thinking, thoughts of harm to self or others
  + Intensity of convictions spectrum: appropriate to interview <=> recurrent themes <=> overvalued ideas (comprehensible idea pursued beyond the bounds of reason) <=> delusions proper
  + Delusions of guilt: psychotic depression
  + Nihilistic delusions: the inside of me is rotting, I have nothing inside me, I am nothing; in an extreme situation, that they are dead or not alive
  + Delusions of jealousy/morbid jealousy
  + Erotomanic delusions – patient convinced someone is in love with them
  + Delusion of reference – believes that things in the environment are related to them. Do you ever see signs in your environment which are related to you? Do you get messages from the TV or radio or social media?
  + Somatic/hypochondriacal delusions
  + Delusions of control: psychosis, Schneiderian first rank symptoms of schizophrenia
  + Thought insertion: do you feel like your thoughts are your own? Do you feel like your thoughts are being broadcast to the world? Schizophrenia.
  + __Overvalued ideas__: belief which is grounded in some reality but takes over a patient’s life
  + Obsession: __unwanted intrusive thought__ or image
  + Way in to thoughts of __harm to self or others__: have you been so depressed that you feel like life isn’t worth living? These people persecuting you, have you ever thought of trying to get to them first? Do you really want to do this? Have you made plans to do this? Have you taken any actions to prepare for this?

Perception: altered bodily experiences (depersonalisation, derealisation), __passivity phenomenon__, illusion, __hallucinations__ (auditory, visual, olfactory, tactile)
- Hallucinations = perception appearing to come from the outside world with all the qualities of a true perception e.g. voices that seem real and coming from a certain direction
- Pseudo-hallucinations = images/voices outside of one’s control but coming from inside. Can occur in psychosis but this is more classical for personality disorders.
- Responding to internal stimuli?

5 Cognition
- __Level of consciousness__: alert, drowsy, delirium, stupor
- Orientation: awareness to __confusion of self, current setting, date__, familiar people
- Attention: need for redirection/repeating, sustained activity, distractibility
- Memory: immediate (repeat numbers or names), short-term (recall three objects at 2 and 5 minutes), long-term (recall events of the past week)
- Ability: impression of current abilities; concrete to abstract thinking

2 Insight: insight + judgement
- Insight: __intact, partial or poor__ insight. Ability to identify potentially pathological events (hallucinations, suicidal impulses); acknowledgement of a possible mental health problem; locus of control (internal v external)
  + Often patients will believe they have a less stigmatising mental illness: pts with psychosis think they are depressed, bipolar
  + External locus of control, blaming everyone else for their issues – personality disorders
  + What the patient feels they should do about their current state, if anything, in context of their current psychological state
- Judgement: intact to impaired judgement. Explore this via recent everyday decision-making)

### Disorders of Thought, Language and Communication (TLC)

Disorders of thought, language and communication (TLC) replaces “formal thought disorder” (FTD).

__MORE PATHOLOGICAL communication disorders:__
- Poverty of content of speech (poverty of thought, alogia, verbigeration, negative FTD) = “long enough” replies which convey little information.
- Pressure of speech = rapid, hard to interrupt, spontaneous speech. In general <150 words/min.
  + If taking phenothiazines or lithium speech can be slowed by meds, and judged only on amount, volume and appropriateness.
- Distractible speech = stopping speech or changing the subject in response to a nearby object.
- Tangentiality = tangential/oblique/irrelevant replies to questions.
- Derailment (flight of ideas, loose associations) = connecting disjointed ideas until the reply is no longer relating to the question at all.
  + Flight of ideas = rapid derailment in context of pressured speech
  + Ideas may be thought logically but not articulated; one can try slowing the patient down

__LESS PATHOLOGICAL communication disorders:__
- Circumstantiality = long-winded replies with too much detail to get to the point
  + Anxious, obsessive individuals. Not necessarily pathological.
- Loss of goal = failure to follow train of speech to its natural conclusion.
- Perseveration = returning to a word or phrase in many different contexts.
- Echolalia = patient echoes words or phrases of interviewer.
- Blocking = end of train of speech before an idea is out + silence + forgets what had been saying.
- Stilted speech
- Self-reference

__MORE PATHOLOGICAL language disorders:__
- Incoherence (word salad, jargon aphasia, schizophasia, paragrammatism) = incomprehensible speech. Word substitutions, deletion of conjunctions, random word choice.
- Clanging = sounds govern word choice.
- Neologisms = completely new words.
- Word approximations (paraphasia, metonymy) = existing words used in place of conventional words. E.g. food vessel = stomach.
- NOT the intentional use of metaphors.

__MORE PATHOLOGICAL Thought disorders:__
-	Poverty of speech (laconic speech, poverty of thought) = little spontaneous speech. Rate from 0 (substantial and appropriate replies), to 4 (essentially mute).
-	Illogicity (absent inferential processe) = illogical conclusions, via non sequiturs or bad inductive reasoning or faulty premises.
  + When the faulty premise is in fact a delusional belief system, apparent illogicity is subsumed under delusions and not considered a separate phenomenon

0 = occasional instances of LESS PATHOLOGICAL and no more than one MORE PATHOLOGICAL instance judged to be clinically insignificant.
1 = occasional instances which are mild but clinically significant
2 = significant and unquestionable instances leading to disturbance in communication
3 = many instances of MORE PATHOLOGICAL impairing communication for substantial part of interview
4 = communication difficult or impossible for most of the interview

### Delusions

- Delusions said to be __fixed false beliefs held with absolute conviction__ even when challenged by the interviewer, __preeminent__ in the patient’s thinking; bizarre logic; contaminate other beliefs about the world; emerge pathologically; incongruent with their cultural context
	+ Probe them – are you sure about this? What evidence do you have?
- Form classed as primary or secondary
	+ Primary delusions are _de novo_. 4 kinds: autochthonous delusions; slowly developing delusionary atmosphere; delusional perception; delusional memory
	+ Secondary delusions are traceable to interactions w the world, or to primary delusions
- Content classed as bizarre vs non-bizarre
	+ Bizarre: fantastic, possibilities endless
	+ Non-bizarre: persecution, passion, identity, grandeur, non-existent, somatic, reference
	+ Affective delusions: in depression – delusions of poverty, worthlessness, guilt, failure, nihilism; in mania – talent, knowledge, power, identity
- Passivity phenomena: “made to” feel/do things
- Obsessional thinking

### Hallucinations

Trying to understand “I’m hearing voices”:
- Just sounds, or voices? Are they loud or soft? Male or female voices? Where are they coming from? What are they saying? How are you feeling about what they are saying?


### Interview Techniques in Psychiatry

Dr Lee Allen: ‘if anyone has an interest in psychiatry/RANZCP feel free to liaise with me’

Changing minds, ABC doco.

HISTORY + MSE + PHYSICAL  FORMULATION + DIAGNOSIS  MANAGEMENT AND PROGNOSIS

- Formulation = answer why is the patient presenting with these sx at this time?
  + Use bio-psycho-social; under each look for predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating and protective factors
- Know enough DSM criteria to justify diagnoses
- 10 rules for good conversations
  + Be present; don’t multitask
  + Don’t pontificate – assume you have something to learn
  + Open-ended, enquiring, curious questions
  + Go with the flow
  + If you don’t know, say so
  + Don’t equate your experience with others’
  + Try not to repeat yourself
  + Stay out of the weeds
  + Listen with the intent to understand, not to reply
  + Be brief
-	Building therapeutic alliance
  + Ask questions like a kid would!
  + “Is that why…”
  + No fear, nothing is awkward
  + Maybe its good to be a bit naïve?
-	Engagement
  + Roles
  + Investment/interest
  + Negotiating
  + Goals mutual
  + Support
-	Info gathering tips
  + Tag timing – was this pre or post COVID?
  + Get people to describe events as a ‘fly on the wall’
  + Reluctance: Why are they reluctant? Normalisation. Expect their symptoms. Guilt reduction. Overshoot the mark – 1) what do you like to drink? 2) how much can you really put away on a big night? Two slabs of beer?
  + Delusional patient: resist early conclusions
-	Socratic questions
  + Clarification: why did you say that?
  + Probe assumption: how did you come to understand this?
  + Probe reason and evidence: what is the evidence?
  + About viewpoints and perspectives: is there any other way to look at it?
  + Probe implications and consequences: what have you done because of this?
  + About the question: what do you make of all this? Have you always felt this way? What does your family think?

### History-taking in Psychiatry

Start with name and age, and your role, then what’s important for the patient. This forms the basis of your lead in to what you want to find out.

- Preparing for the interview
  + File review
  + See the pt at 90 degrees rather than front on – less confrontational
- Demographic
- HOPC
  + What sequence of events got them here
  + Timeline, what noticed, when last well
  + Precipitants: death, divorce, debt, drugs, drama, disease
  + Current substance use and relation to Sx
  + Protective factors
  + Perpetuating factors
  + Relevant negatives in systems review
  + Insight
  + Impact – ADLs, finances, domestic, self-care
  + Risk – self, others, property
-	Review of systems
-	PMHx
  + Psych, medical, substance, forensic (police/legal)
  + Diagnosis
  + Treatments
  + Risk when unwell
  + Community MH follow-up
  + Voluntary or involuntary Rx?
  + Medications: Psychotropics. Medical. Prescribed, non-prescribed, OTC. __SafeScript – benzos, opioids, quetiapine__
-	FHx
  + Genogram
  + Did you feel loved growing up?
  + Occupation of family members – expectation, impairment
  + MH: suicide, treatment, diagnoses
  + SES, where and how did you grow up, life events
-	Developmental history
  + Birth: hypoxia, trauma, postnatal depression in mother, season of birth
  + Milestones: walking, talking, toilet training, separation anxiety, illness
  + School: strengths, academic, friendships, authority, antisocial, when left school
  + Vocational history: number of jobs, length of time, why change, who instigated
  + Relationships: friends, how long, sexual, orientation, longest, few, many, why changes
-	Social history – difficult questions
  + Abuse: physical, neglect, emotional, sexual
  + Trauma: assault, rape, foster care
  + Accommodation, employment, finances, supports, relationship status, activities, ADLs, cultural background, religion
-	Premorbid personality
  + Enduring qualities or patterns of behaviour
  + Defences
  + Coping strategies at times of transition
  + How would your friends describe you? Do you think that’s accurate?
  + Before illness

Consider collateral history – consent from patient first.

## Anxiety and Related Disorders

Cognitive behavioural standpoint: conditioned responses, habitual thinking and behaviour --> anxiety

Biologic standpoint: disturbed central neurotransmission + stress pathways (HPA axis and sympathetic NS) --> anxiety

### Core Diagnoses

-	__Panic attack__: 4/13 symptoms from the heart/breathless/fear clusters
  + 3 heart: palpitations, chest pain, nausea
  + 5 breathlessness: SOB, choking sensation, dizziness, paraesthesias, chills or hot flushes
  + 5 fear: fear of dying, fear of going crazy, shaking, sweating, derealisation, depersonalisation
-	__Panic disorder__: recurrent unexpected panic attacks AND following attack, at least one of persistent concern, worry about implications or significant change in behaviour +/- agoraphobia
-	__Simple phobias__: anxiety linked to something resulting in avoidance impeding function
  + Exposure/response prevention (EX/RP)
-	__Social anxiety disorder (SAD)__/Social phobia: avoidance of new social situations for fear of embarrassment/humiliation
-	__Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)__: predominant free-floating anxiety most days > 6 months. 3/6 sx.
-	__Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)__: obsessions +/- compulsions persisting for >1 hour/day
  + Ask: if you don't do the compulsive activity, what happens to the obsession?
-	__Post-traumatic stress disorder__: the person has experienced a traumatic event and responded with intense fear, helplessness, horror
  + Re-experiencing the trauma by intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares
  +	Avoidance of stimuli associated with trauma
  +	Numbing of general responsiveness: avoiding things associated with the trauma, amnesia for the trauma, restricted affect and activities, detachment, foreshortened future
  +	Arousal symptoms: insomnia, irritability, hypervigilance, startle response, poor concentration

### Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

-	GAD = __excessive free-floating anxiety__ or worry __most days__ for at least __6 months__
-	Symptoms: need 3/6 of
  + Restlessness, feeling on edge
  +	Fatigue
	+ Decreased concentration
  +	Irritability
  +	Muscle tension
  +	Poor sleep
-	Epi: risk increased in low SES, single, divorced. Mean onset 30 yo.
-	Screening: look for excessive worry about minor things, frequent tension
-	Treatment: lifestyle + psychotherapy (CBT in the main) +/- anxiolytics
  + CBT = psychoeducation + stimulus control techniques + cognitive restructuring + behaviour modification + self-monitoring + relaxation + worry exposure + problem solving
  + Other psychotherapies: acceptance and commitment therapy ([RACGP on ACT](https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2012/september/acceptance-and-commitment-therapy)), mindfulness
  + Anxiolytics: benzodiazepines are effective but have problems with tolerance and dependence. Use short term <6/52 only.
  + Antidepressants: SSRIs and SNRIs useful adjunct when presenting with GAD + mood disturbance.
  + Symptomatic agents: beta blockers
-	Outlook: 50% remission in treatment completers

### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

![How obsessions lead to compulsions.](https://github.com/wollemia/md/blob/main/OCD.png)

-	Obsessions
  + Recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses or images.
  + Not excessive worries about real-life problems
  + Attempts to suppress or neutralise thoughts
  + Recognised as product of their own mind; initially seen as ridiculous; unwanted

-	Compulsions (checking, watching, counting)
  + Repetitive behaviours or mental acts that they feel driven to perform
  + Aimed at preventing or reducing distress

-	Epi: risk increased in those completing secondary education, individuals with OPCD
-	Screening: look for ideas or thoughts which seem silly but make them anxious. Do they do anything to counter this anxiety? How much time/day does this take up?
  + Exclude physical morbidities – Tourette’s, Sydenham’s chorea
-	Treatment: CBT clear winner in psychotherapy (key process is exposure --> response prevention)
  + Psychodynamic therapy ineffective
  + Pharmacotherapy: serotonergic antiDs only. Higher doses for longer periods.

### Panic Disorder +/- Agoraphobia

-	Panic attack = __4/13__ symptoms from the heart/breathless/fear clusters
  + 3 heart: __palpitations, chest pain, nausea__
  + 5 breathlessness: __SOB, choking sensation, dizziness, paraesthesias, chills or hot flushes__
  + 5 fear: __fear of dying, fear of going crazy, shaking, sweating, derealisation, depersonalisation__
-	Panic disorder = __4 or more episodes over a 1 month period__ not otherwise explained
  + Recurrent unexpected panic attacks
  + __Inter-panic anxiety__: following attack, at least one of persistent concern, worry about implications or significant change in behaviour
  + Psychic features: thoughts of imminent death, depersonalisation
  + Somatic features: SOB, chest pain, hyperventilation, tachycardia, awareness of heartbeat, light-headedness, peripheral tingling, sweating, nausea, diarrhoea
  + __+/- Agoraphobia__ = fear of being places where escape is difficult, and efforts to avoid such places (or endured with marked distress)
-	Epi: commonest onset early adulthood, 50% of presentations are before age 24
-	Screening: look for episodes of sudden onset intense fear or other physical symptoms which defy reason. How common are these? Do they cause you to avoid certain situations?
-	Treatment: limit inappropriate investigations. Lifestyle + CBT + stress management +/- pharmacological Rx
  + CBT focus is psychotherapy + relaxation + cognitive interventions + exposure and avoidance of safety behaviours
  + Anxiolytics: esp. clonazepam and alprazolam. Short term only <6/52.
  + Antidepressants (best): TCAs, SSRIs, MAOIs, SNRIs – main barrier is tolerability.
-	Outlook: high response rates in treatment completers

### PTSD

-	Symptoms fall into three clusters: __re-experiencing__ (nightmares, flashbacks), __hyperarousal__ (anxiety, irritability, increased startle), and __avoidance__ (numbing, avoiding reminders, unable to feel closeness, amnesia of event)
-	Incidence following specific traumas: accidents <=10%, non-sexual assaults <= 25%, rape <= 50%
-	__Presentation frequently delayed, often w/ depression, substance abuse, thru legal system (“forensic problem”)__
-	Screening: look for the event and associated flashbacks
-	Treatment: stabilise lifestyle, treat substance & depression. Trust is key!
  + Psychotherapy is CBT (best) and possibly EMDR
  + CBT focus is anger management and anxiety early, and exposure to traumatic memories later
  + Level I evidence for SSRIs, SNRIs, mirtazapine. Maybe atypical antipsychotics.

### Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)

-	Persistent __fear of social situations/exposure in public__ --> anticipatory thoughts of embarrassment or humiliation --> anxiety --> avoidance --> impairment
-	Epi: More common than OCD and panic disorder, more common in well-educated individuals. Onset late primary school. Present w/ depression or substance abuse
-	Screening: uncomfortable meeting new people? How were they at school?
-	Treatment: __CBT is best__
  + Emphasis on the behavioural component of CBT
  + Some evidence for IPT, SST
  + Level I evidence for SSRIs, SNRIs, mirtazapine, MAOIs, short-term clonazepam (response to pharma often partial)


## ADHD

“A persistent pattern of inattention, disorganisation and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development”
-	Pattern of symptoms + co-morbidity + shared risk factors --> ADHD classed as a neurodevelopmental disorder
  + The same data also support arguments to place ADHD within disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders
-	Don’t usually diagnose <6 years
-	Several symptoms present < age 12 and for > 6 months
-	Present in two or more settings
-	Negatively impacting social, academic or occupational activities
-	Symptoms do not occur exclusively in the setting of another psych disorder

__Pathophysiology__: Associated with genes regulating dopamine and noradrenaline

__Inattention and disorganisation__: inability to stay on task, seeming not to listen, and losing materials, at levels that are inconsistent with age or developmental level.

__Hyperactivity-impulsivity__: overactivity, fidgeting, inability to stay seated, intruding into others’ activities, and inability to wait, excessively for age or developmental level.

### Epidemiology & Risk factors

-	5% of school age kids, 2.5% of adults, M > F
-	Differences in presentation across genders: F more likely to present with inattentive symptoms
-	Many kids with ADHD also have a specific learning disorder
-	Frequent overlaps in childhood with oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder (“externalising disorders”)

Break down into child, parent and medical risk factors

-	Child factors
  + Predisposing but not specific: reduced behavioural inhibition, effortful control/constraint, negative emotionality, elevated novelty seeking
  + Often overlap w/ ADHD: developmental delay, language delay, learning difficulties
  + Possible influences: sleep disorders, nutritional deficiencies, visual and hearing impairments, metabolic abnormalities and epilepsy
-	Parent or family factors
  + Child abuse, neglect, multiple foster placements
  + Smoking during pregnancy is associated; part of this is down to common genetic risk
  + Family interaction patterns in early childhood area unlikely to cause ADHD but may influence its course or contribute to secondary development of conduct problems
  + Ancestral history of ADHD – substantial heritability (but genes correlated with ADHD are neither necessary nor sufficient factors).
-	Medical factors
  + Very low birth weight (<1500g) confers a 2-3x risk for ADHD, however most kids with low BW still do not develop ADHD
  + Exposure to alcohol in-utero

### Types of ADHD

There are three subtypes of ADHD: combined, inattentive, and hyperactive-impulsive
-	Combined type: at least 6 symptoms of inattention and 6 sx of hyperactivity-impulsivity
-	Predominantly inattentive type: at least 6 symptoms of inattention
-	Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type: at least 6 symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity

### Symptoms

Core symptoms of inattention
-	Careless mistakes or fails to give close attention to detail
-	Difficulty remaining focussed during tasks or play (eg lectures, conversations, lengthy reading)
-	Not seeming to listen when spoken to directly (even in the absence of obvious distraction)
-	Not following through on instructions and failing to finish schoolwork, chores, workplace duties
-	Difficulty organising tasks and activities – messy, disorganised, poor time management, fails to meet deadlines
-	Avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (eg schoolwork and homework; for older adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers)
-	Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities
-	Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (includes unrelated thoughts for adults)
-	Forgetful in daily activities (chores, errands, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments)

Core symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity
-	Fidgets, taps hands and feet, squirms in seat
-	Often leaves seat in situations where remaining seated is expected
-	Runs about and climbs in situations where it is inappropriate (in adolescents or adults may be limited to feeling restless)
-	Unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly
-	On the go, driven by a motor – unable to be or uncomfortable being still for long periods of time (in restaurants, meetings)
-	Often answers before a question is completed
-	Cannot wait for turn in conversation/in an activity
-	Often interrupts or intrudes on others (eg conversations, games, activities)

Assessment requires a full medical history and examination, including
-	Neurodevelopmental assessment
-	Family history
-	Sociocultural, family and school environments
-	Academic progress
-	Socialisation
-	Behavioural history
-	Formal assessment of hearing, cognition, language and intellect

### Differential diagnosis for ADHD

-	__Oppositional defiant disorder__ – these individuals resist conforming to others’ demands which may look like an attention deficit. Complicating this differential is the fact that some with ADHD develop secondary oppositional attitudes towards mentally demanding tasks.
-	__Intermittent explosive disorder__ – impulsivity is shared with ADHD, serious aggression towards others is not characteristic of ADHD. Individuals with IED also do not develop problems sustaining attention.
-	Other neurodevelopmental disorders – especially disorders with repetitive motor behaviour like stereotypic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum disorder; also, the tics of Tourette’s can be mistaken for fidgetiness of ADHD.
-	Specific learning disorder – inattention is impairing only in academics, rather than everywhere as with ADHD
-	Intellectual disability
-	Autism spectrum disorder
-	Reactive attachment disorder
-	Anxiety disorder
-	Depressive disorders
-	Bipolar disorder
-	Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
-	Substance use disorders
-	Personality disorders
-	Psychotic disorders
-	Medication-induced symptoms of ADHD
-	Neurocognitive disorders

### Treatment and Progression

Management plan is a combination of medication and psychosocial strategies
-	Psychosocial: use behavioural, environmental and time management strategies
  + Behavioural: we try to reinforce positive and reduce negative behaviours; anticipate, plan and teach how to avoid difficulties
  + Environmental: sit up front, avoid distractions, fidget toys, break tasks down, frequent breaks
  + Time management: checklists, prompts, timers
-	Medication: only after age 6
  + 1st line are stimulants: methylphenidate (Ritalin or concerta), or dexamphetamine (with psychologist referral)
  + Safe and effective medications; benefits for long-term social, educational and vocational outcomes greatly outweigh the minimal side effects
  + Meds protect against future substance abuse
- Functional consequences:
  +	Academic deficits, school-related problems and peer neglect tend to be most associated with elevated symptoms of inattention
  +	Peer rejection and to a lesser extent accidental injury are more salient with hyperactive and impulsive symptoms

## Delirium

Responding to Ten Common Delirium Misconceptions
With Best Evidence: An Educational Review
for Clinicians

Oldham et al. 2018.

### 3D-CAM Screen

“3-minute diagnostic interview for confusion assessment” method

-	Make sure the patient’s glasses are ON and hearing aids are IN
-	Prepare yourself to code what you see and hear
-	Make no assumptions on the cause of any behaviour and take notes
-	Each question can be stated twice
-	“I don’t know,” no response, or a nonsensical response all count as incorrect

Orientation
1.	What is the year?
2.	What day of the week is it?
3.	Where are we now, what kind of place are we in?
Attention
4.	Repeat these digits backwards.
5.	Days of the week backwards
6.	Months of the year backwards
Patient-reported symptoms
7.	Have you felt confused during the last day?
8.	During the past day did you think you were not really here (in hospital)?
9.	During the past day, have you seen things that were not really there?
Observational items
10.	Was the patient sleepy, stuporous, or comatose during the interview?
11.	Did the patient show hypervigilance (excessively strong responses to ordinary objects/stimuli)?
12.	Was the patient’s flow of ideas unclear or illogical?
13.	Was the conversation rambling, with inappropriately verbose and off-target responses?
14.	Was their speech unusually limited or sparse? Unusually slow or halting?
15.	Did the patient have trouble keeping track of what was being said during the interview?
16.	Failing to attend to the interview due to distraction by environmental stimuli?
Fluctuation
17.	Fluctuating level of consciousness
18.	Fluctuation in attention
19.	Fluctuation in speech or thought
Change from baseline
20.	Collateral history from family/friend/carer/other treating team member
21.	Review previous 3D-CAM assessments

## Eating Disorders

Distinguish anorexia nervosa from bulimia nervosa

Anorexia nervosa restricting type or binge-purging type.

Psychiatric treatment of anorexia nervosa

### Starvation syndrome

Physical signs
* Emaciated frame
* Psychomotor retardation
* Stupor
* Autonomic dysfunction
  + Hypotension: LV shrinkage, valve prolapse
  + Bradycardia
  + Arrhythmia: relating to the hypokalemia
  + Postural drop: autonomic dysfunction + changes to heart structurally
* Peripheral shutdown: cyanosis of fingers, cool peripheries
* Carotinemia: vitamin A related yellowing of extremities  
* Russell's sign: calluses on kuckes of people who engage in purging
* Easy bruising: reduced plt count due to bone marrow suppression
* Hyperventilation from metabolic acidosis
* Hypothermia
* Lanugo: fine baby hairs (POMC???)
* Cyanosis
* Dehydration
* Parotid enlargement
* Poor dentition
* breast atrophy
* Infection due to low WCC
* Systolic flow murmur: valvular dysfunction
* Oedema: low albumin, CCF

Two important investigations:
* Blood tests: hypokalaemia if vomiting, laxatives; HCO3<30 if vomiting, laxatives (metabolic alkalosis); urea low in restricting but increased if dehydrated; hypoNa if overhydrating  
* ECG
* DEXA scan for osteopoenia


## First Natiions Mental Health

### Historical context

Elder knowledge central to keeping communities safe

- __Strength and resilience__
- Connection to country
- Connection to each other

### Social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) framework

- Social - the right to self-determination
- Emotional
- Spiritual
- Cultural - diversity
- Connection to country

The term recognises the connection to land, culture, spirituality, family, community, and how they impact on peoples' wellbeing; and the impact of the one's wellbeing on the others.

In your clinical experience how often have you applied a SEWB framework?
- how would you navigate this in future
- One ting I really struggle with is when overworked teams overlook the SEWB model -- what is a productive way to intervene and redirect things to not be shit.

Headwinds:
- "Since their first intrusive gaze, colonising cultures have had a preoccupation with observing, analysing and studying, classifying and labelling [Aboriginal people] and Aboriginality. Under that gaze, Aboriginal has changed from being a daily practive to being a 'problem to be solved'." Pat Dodson, 2003 p27
- Colonisation: Its bad for your health.
- Racism: internalised (within the individual), interpersonal (shown between individuals by words and actions), institutional (discriminatory policies), systemic (maintained by society) levels.

Tailwinds:

### Engagement in Services

Tracy Westerman - Nyamal woman from Pilbara region of WA
- Indigenous psychologist writing in 2004

[Westerman T. Engagement of indigenous clients in mental health services: what role do cultural differences play? Aust EJ Adv Ment Health 2004;3(3):1-8. (Journal article)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.7532&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

- Mob in contact with MH services are more likely to receive reactive care - basic counselling, advocacy, support, diversionary activities
- Fewer preventative and therapeutic levels of intervention despite the obvious need
- Practitioners desire to be "culturally appropriate" but have no empirical conceptual framework for this w/ mob w/ specific MH issues
- What is the actual basis for the failure i.e. cultural inappropraiteness?
  + Inappropriate processes of engagement: introductions; misreading of cultral context; mental health as holistic; cultural consultants; putting people on the spot for a direct answer
  + Practitioner-client realtionship: cultural disparity. Gender differences.
- What will help?
  + Cultural supervision
  + Outreach
  + Referral processes
  + Understanding the traditional hierarchy of treatment interventions in Aboriginal culture i.e. respect for Old Knowledge. Recognising Old Knowledge solutions to MH problems. Old Knowledge certainly does not involve institutionalisation.

### Asessment and Management

[Working Together](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/globalassets/media/documents/aboriginal-health/working-together-second-edition/working-together-aboriginal-and-wellbeing-2014.pdf)



## Mental Health Act

Geared to promoting patient autonomy and rights.

-	Assessment and treatment to be provided in the least restrictive way
-	Patient should be involved in decisions and have views respected, even if they are receiving compulsory care under the Act
-	Patients are allowed to make decisions which carry risks
-	First Nations peoples should have culture and identity recognised and responded to
-	Carers should have their role recognised and be involved in decision making
-	If receiving compulsory treatment the psychiatrist must give the person a statement of rights and an oral explanation of their rights
-	All patients have access to legal aid as desired

__Mental illness__ == a medical condition characterised by a __significant disturbance of thought, mood, perception or memory__

![Order of orders in the mental health act](https://github.com/wollemia/md/blob/main/MHAct.png)

The orders can be revoked at any point (AO, TTO, TO) by the psychiatrist or the MH tribunal. Once an order is revoked the pt becomes voluntary.

### Assessment order (AO)

AO is analogous to a medical practitioner or MH clinician incurring a MET call: "I think there is something worrying/risky here and I need help with that."

Criteria for an AO per the Victorian MHA 2014:
1. Person __appears to have a mental illness__ - a significant disturbance of thought, mood, perception, memory
2. Due to apparent mental illness, the person appears to need immediate treatment to __prevent__:
  + __serious deterioration__ in the person's mental or physical health; or
  + __serious harm__ to the person or another person
3. Assessment/treatment is __available__
4. The assessment/treatment has to be the __least restrictive__ - that which infringes the least on their human rights (e.g. voluntary assessment is not an option)

The time on the AO needs to be 5 mins _after_ the time on the assessment itself.

An AO lasts 24 hours before needing conversion by a psychiatrist to a TTO. You can extend an assessment order by 24 hours 2x maximum.

### Treatment orders (TTOs and TOs)

A Temporary Treatment Order (TTO) lasts maximum 28 days. After this the clinician must decide whether to go to the tribunal, who decide whether to convert to a TO or dissolve the TTO.

Q == is the mental illness affecting their ability to make decisions?

Section 5 Criteria for a TTO or a TO per the Victorian MHA 2014:
1. Person __has a mental illness__ - a significant disturbance of thought, mood, perception, memory
2. Due to mental illness, the person needs immediate treatment to __prevent__:
  + __serious deterioration__ in the person's mental or physical health; or
  + __serious harm__ to the person or another person
3. __Immediate__ treatment will be provided
4. The treatment is the __least restrictive__ - that which infringes the least on their human rights (e.g. voluntary assessment is not an option)

### Tribunal processes

Report prepared by treating team --> provide to patient and tribunal.
- Refer to patient in 2nd person
- Focus on section 5 criteria and rationale for TO or TTO

Present at the tribunal
- Patient if they wish
- Patient legal representation if requested
- Treating team w a dr at a minimum
- Panel members: independent medical member (usu psychiatrist or GP with interest in psych), community member, legal member

Discussion with everyone present
- Whether the s5 criteria are met
- Whether there are less restrictive means available
  + Community order vs inpatient
  + shorter duration of order
- Less formal than court but still a formal hearing

### Capacity Assessments

There are only __four criteria__ which must be met if a patient is to be said to have capacity:
1. Understand the information given about illness/treatment options
2. Remember the information given
3. Use the information to make a decision on their treatment
4. Ability to communicate that decision to you the treating team

In reality, if a treatment option is low risk and likely reward, there is a lower bar for passing a capacity assessment than if a treatment option is high risk and less likely to benefit the patient.

![Capacity thresholds](https://github.com/wollemia/md/blob/main/capacity.png)

### Cases

24F with anorexia nervosa, admitted voluntary to medical ward due to severe postural hypotension, postural tachycardia, prolonged QTc, bradycardia on ECG. Has had syncopal and pre-syncopal episodes on rising from bed. Hx recent rapid weight loss, BMI 13. Has pulled out NGT and refusing further treatment wanting to self d/c. Accepting of her illness but not wanting treatment in hospital.

--> Place this person under the MHA as she has a mental illness and there is no less restrictive treatment available to prevent serious physical deterioration (those CVS symptoms are serious).

## Mood disorders

-	In DSM-IV, depressive disorders were in the same chapter as bipolar disorders. Now in DSM-V they are separated.
-	Common features of both are sad, empty, irritable mood, with somatic and cognitive changes hurting function
-	Differing features are duration/timing, and presumed aetiology

LOs

-	Principal clinical features of depression and bipolar disorders (as well as related disorders)
-	Discuss differential diagnosis of mood disorders
-	Common comorbidities, diagnostic dilemmas
-	Epidemiology wrt global burden of disease
-	Critically examine controversies surrounding mood disorders
-	Aetiological theories
-	Course and prognosis
-	Treatment approaches

### Elements of the Mood Disorders

-	Major depressive episode: _DIG SPACES_. Five or more, with depressed mood or anhedonia for __>2 weeks__, including one/both of depressed mood or anhedonia.
  + Depressed mood
  + __Interest or pleasure deficit__ (anhedonia)
  + __Guilt__ (worthlessness, hopelessness)
  + __Sleep disorder__ (increase or decrease) --> Ask if trouble getting to sleep, staying asleep, or __waking too early__?
  + Psychomotor retardation/agitation
  + Appetite disorder (increase or decrease)
  + Concentration deficit, rumination
  + Energy deficit
  + Suicidality
-	Manic episode: _DIG FAST_. __Elevated mood with 3/7__, or __irritable mood with 4/7__ for 1 week:
  + Distractibility
  + Indiscretion (excessive sex, drinking, drugs)
  + Grandiosity
  + Flight of ideas
  + Activity increase
  + Sleep deficit (decreased need for sleep)
  + Talkativeness (pressured speech)
-	Dysthymia: __“allergic” to happiness__. _ACHEWS_.
  + Appetite disorder (increase or decrease)
  + Concentration deficit
  + Hopelessness
  + Energy deficit
  + Worthlessness
  + Sleep disorder (increase or decrease)
-	Neuro-vegetative symptoms: biological symptoms towards measuring the severity of the depression.
  + Sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, psychomotor retardation (most specific), impaired concentration, working memory deficits, libidinal changes
-	Cognitive-affective symptoms: anxiety, helplessness, __worthlessness__ (increased chance of suicidality), social withdrawal, depersonalisation/derealisation, guilt, shame, rage, nihilism, hopelessness, suicidal ideation
-	Suicidality: insomnia, weight loss and LOA, worthlessness, guilt, thoughts of death, impulsive/aggressive behaviour.
o	10-15% ever hospitalised will suicide
o	Women to men 2:1 for the mood disorders but 1:4 for suicide rate
-	Psychotic features: usually (not always) mood congruent. Hallucinations 10-20%. Delusions almost invariable. Compare with transient reality testing changes in borderline PD.
  + 80% response rate to ECT or antipsychotic + antidepressant (25-50% response rate to either alone)
  + Often missed – indirect approach to questioning useful

Darkness visible: “My few hours of sleep were usually terminated at three or four in the morning, when I stared up into yawning darkness… I’m fairly certain that it was during one of these insomnia trances that there came over me the knowledge that this condition would cost me my life… I had not conceived precisely how my end would come. In short I was keeping the idea of suicide at bay…what I had begun to discover is that the grey drizzle of horror, induced by the depression, takes on the quality of physical pain…”

### Depressive Disorders

-	__Major Depressive Disorder__, Single or Recurrent episodes (each > 2 weeks)
  + Specify: mild/moderate/severe; with anxious distress (specify mild/moderate/severe); with melancholic features; with mixed features; with atypical features; with mood-congruent psychotic features; with catatonia; with peripartum onset; with seasonal pattern
  + Never had a manic or hypomanic episode
-	__Dysthymic Disorder__: 2/6 dysthymic symptoms with depressed mood for 2 years
-	__Postpartum depression__: ~10% of mothers, half are severe. 4-12 weeks post-partum. Significant contributor to postpartum mortality. Impact on attachment and development. Assoc. postpartum thyroiditis. 50% recurrence. Suicide leading cause of maternal death in the UK.
-	In kids: subtle MSE changes. Compare behaviour and mood to peers of similar age, gender, and IQ. Function in classroom, playground and home. Utilise several sources. Comorbidity is the rule not the exception. Usually preceded by dysthymia and/or anxiety for <=3 years.
-	In older adults: loss (loved ones, home, work, health, independence, wealth, social group) and organic disorders are common precipitants. Somatic complaints prominent. Irritable more often than sad.

AETIOLOGY: Bio-psycho-social approach
-	Bio: heritability is 40-70%. Genetic overlap w/ anxiety, neuroticism acting by increasing sensitivity to life events. Structurally, hippocampus smaller, ventricles larger. Monoamine, neurotrophin, NMDA cascade changes; also cortisol, HPA and SNS changes.
-	Psycho:
	 + In childhood: parental loss or detached parenting --> insecure attachment --> moodiness, depressive sx, poor peer relations and aggression into adolescence. One good relationship and ?higher IQ are protective. Cumulative disadvantage supersedes any single factor.
  + In adulthood: continuously married < always single < divorced and separated. Indifferent or controlling intimate other --> increased risk non-endogenous depression. Confiding in others is protective.
-	Social: precipitating events in preceding 6 months (loss, humiliation, entrapment, danger). Employment and financial independence associated w/ lower rates. Neutralising/fresh start events assoc. w/ remission.
  + (Economic status <-> mood disorder) mediated by social isolation

DIFFERENTIALS:
-	Hypothyroidism
-	Cushing’s/Addison’s
-	Cancers: pancreatic (ACTH, CRH), SCLC, paraneoplastic syndromes, hyperCa++
  + 33% of Ca patients are also depressed
-	Multiple sclerosis
-	HIV/AIDS
-	Neurological conditions
  + Stroke
  + Parkinson’s & diseases of the basal ganglia
  + Pseudo-depression: apathy, motor slowness and poverty of speech in damage to frontal convexity
  + Orbito-frontal lesions: shallow jocularity and disinhibition
-	Drug-induced mood disorders
  + Monoamine depletion: reserpine, propranolol, alpha-methyldopa
  + Corticosteroids dose effect >= 80mg pred = 64mg methylpred = 12mg dex
  + GABA-ergics: benzodiazepines, vigapatrin, phenobarbitone, alcohol
  + Chemotherapy agents
  + Oxycontin?
  + Interferon
-	Bereavement: feelings of intense sadness, rumination, insomnia, poor appetite and weight loss are appropriate responses to loss. Consider MDD in addition to the normal response.
  + Major differentiator from depression is preoccupation in thought content: in grief, it is the loss/lack, in depression, it is worthlessness/low opinion of self.
  + Characteristic timeline of grief is in waves.
  + Medications alone for complicated grief are a waste of time.
-	Psychiatric co-morbidities: alcohol and drug dependence, anxiety disorder (usually predates depression in course), personality disorders

TIMELINE:
-	15-20% of the population will experience depression in their lifetime
  + 4% have experienced it in the last month
  + 50% experience a recurrence
  + If had >3 episodes, 80% recur
  + 50% are symptom free between episodes
-	Modally lasts 9 months untreated
-	150 million

TREATMENT: Bio-psycho…you get the idea
-	Bio: SSRIs (sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine). SNIRs (venlafaxine, duloxetine). Mirtazapine. TCAs (nortriptyline, imipramine). Lithium. T3 (if FHx thyroid). SGAs. 6-12 weeks of full dose, maintain for 6-12/12 post-recovery.
  + ECT used for melancholic depression, psychotic depression, puerperal depression, bipolar depression or mania, prominent suicidality, poor oral intake.
-	Psycho: CBT, IPT, couple therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy
-	Social: exercise, lifestyle, confiding other.

### Bipolar Disorders

-	Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (used to be Bipolar in kids < 12) = kids with persistent irritability and extreme behavioural dyscontrol
-	__Bipolar I__ Disorder: manic/mixed episode +/- depressive episode
-	__Bipolar II__ Disorder: hypomanic episode + depressive episode
-	Cyclothymic Disorder: 2 years of hypomanic sx + depressive sx


AETIOLOGY:
-	Bio: genetic, head injury, organic CNS disease (older patients), AIDS, childbirth
-	Psycho: sleep disruption
-	Social: seasonal

TIMELINE:
-	Hypomania: increased wellbeing, irritable mood, busy, pressured speech, more phone calls, seductive. Lasting 2-4 days to a week.
-	Mania: nearly always pleasant/cheerful, occasional loss of insight, impulsive, angry, hyperactive, less sleep, more pressure of speech, repeated phone calls, racing thoughts, expansive, some grandiosity. Lasting more than 1 week.
-	Mania with psychotic features: labile, very angry, intrusive, uncooperative, agitated, no sleep, very talkative, loud, flight of ideas, grandiose, religious delusions, sexual preoccupations
-	Rapid cycling: >4 episodes in a year
-	Mixed states: depressive + manic symptoms for 1-2 weeks.
-	__Usually presents as depression --> mania ~5 years on__
  + Beginning in adolescence as mild, brief and uncharacteristic
  + Median duration is 4.2 months, 25% are above 7.3 months
  + 20-30 cases are biphasic
  + Interval contracts then stabilises
  + 3x longer depressed than manic overall
  + 2x depressive episodes of unipolar patients
  + Incomplete remission is common
  + Functional recovery follows symptomatic recovery

DIFFERENTIALS:
-	Schizophrenia
-	Primary organic state
-	Drug-induced psychosis (cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, cannabinoids)
-	Euthymia in depressives (experienced as hypomania)
-	Creative “possessed by the muse”
-	Extroverted, cyclothymic, borderline, or histrionic personality manifestations

TREATMENT:
-	Bio: mood stabilisers, SGAs, antidepressants
- The pharmacological approach is __dependent on pattern of depressive and manic episodes__.
  + __Acute mania: atypical antipsychotic (quetiapine) + lithium__ (Li is slow to reach therapeutic concentrations). Anticonvulsant for elevated mood; benzo for aggression, violence, agitation, overacitvity, disinhibition.
  + __Acute depression__: options. Consider __antidepressant in combination with mood stabiliser__; consider __adjusting the dose__ of the prophylactic agent (Li) alone. __AntiDs alone__ can switch someone back into a manic phase (--> __rapid cycling__ bipolar) so we avoid. Consider adding another mood stabiliser - lamotrigine an option, Stevens-Johnson the worry. Valproate used to be used routinely but causes spina bifida & can worsen PCOS. Consider clozapine and lithium in the suicidal bipolar patient.
  + ECT
-	Psycho: education, adjustment, lifestyle, harm reduction

### Lithium therapy

- Medical history and physical exam
- Biochemistry
  + Thyroid
  + UEC
  + Urinalysis
  + CrCl
  + FBE + diff
- ECG
- Pregnancy test
- Repeat TSH, T3, T4 and UEC (CrCl) q6/12
  + Thyroxine used where necessary
- Initial dose 400-800mg/day as Li carbonate
- 12hr serum Li within 5 days
- Adjust dose to therapeutic range
- Narrow TI
  + 0.4 mM MIC; >1.5 mM TIC
  + regular checks throughout treatment
  + review SEs
  + patient __and GP__ education
- SEs: memory, thirst, polyuria, tremor, drowsiness, weight gain, metallic taste, sexual problems - dose, CrCl and age related. Most complaints within 2/52 of starting drug or increasing dose.

## Organic psychiatry

General medical disorders contributing to psych
- _Depressive disorders_: high or low __thyroid__, high or low __adrenal cortical hormones__ (endogenous and exogenous), high or low __Ca__, vitamin deficiencies. __ABI__ (incl. post-concussion syndrome), cerebrovascular diseases, infections, neoplasia, demyelination, autoimmune, toxins
  + Delirium -[sometimes]-> depression
  + Dementias <-[associated]-> depression
- _Anxiety disorders_: cardiovascular (e.g. __SVT__), delirium, dementia, ABI, thyroid, Ca, adrenal medullary hormones, infections, neoplasia, demyelination, autoimmune dse, toxins
- _Schizophreniform psychosis_: delirium, dementia, ABI, CVD, infections (viral), demyelination, autoimmune, hypothyroidism, low Ca, exogenous corticosteroids.

Psychiatric disorders secondary to medical disorders:
- Delirium
- Dementia: secondary to brain disease, progressive in nature, accompanied by disorder of higher cortical functions (memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning, language, judgement)
  + Reversible causes: hypothyroidism, vit deficiencies, normal/low pressure hydrocephalus, autoimmune vasculitis, infection (HIV, neurosyphilis), ICH, sub-dural haematoma, neoplasia, DM, chronic untreated anaemia, apathetic delirium.
  + Irreversible causes: Alzheimers, vascular, mixed Alzheimers + cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's dse/Lewy body dementia, Huntington's disease, alcohol-related dementia, MS/demyelination.

### Huntington's disease

- Inherited progressive neurodegenerative psychiatric disease. Degeneration of striatum --> widespread cerebral degeneration.
- Autosomal dominant inheritance: 50% offspring at risk.
- Gene on chromosome 4 with unstable CAG repeat of increased length

Clinical
- Commonly onset in 50s.
- Cognitive dysfunction: occurs early in progression. Memory impairment, executive impairment (verbal fluency, planning, sequential activities), visuospatial skills.
- Classic abnormal movements: __chorea__, choreoatheosis, impaired oculomotor functions, __coordination__, dysphagia, dysarthria ,Rigidity, bradykinesia, myoclonus, bruxism, dystonia also.
- Apathy, irritability, aggression, dysphoria, generalised anxiety, OCD.
- MDD or Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophreniform psychosis seen in many patients with Htt dse.
- Suicide risk incredibly high after Dx been made

Management
- Progress cannot be slowed - supportive psychotherapy is essential.

### Vitamin deficiencies

Thiamine: Wernicke-Korsakoff.
- WERNICKE TRIAD = confusion, ataxia, opthalmoplegia/nystagmus
  + Treating with 300mg TDS thiamine prevents progression to Korsakoff
- Irreversible severe anterograde amnesia, apathy, poor insight, confabulation (Korsakoff)

Other B-group vitamins: Depressive sx, encephalopathy, dementia.
- Nangs: oxidise the cobalt in cobalamin (=B12) and cause deficiency

### CASES

1. Nicole

22F on ward walking to other rooms, threatening other patients, confusion,memory loss, paranoia

Collateral: 3/52 fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea. Headaches have continued. Forgetting plans, getting uncharacteristically angry at partner. Face twitching, 4d ago had a seizure (no past hx of sz).

More:
- Past psych hx
- full history of the headaches: generalised persistent headache.
- EtOH and drug hx: social drinker nil other drugs.
- clarify what happened 3 weeks ago: had a viral illness then
- paranoid about you and her partner
- feels unsafe in hospital
- perceptual disturbances: olfactory hallucinations fo something dead, visual hallucinations of people entering her room at night, auditory hallucinations of people laughing at her, food tastes strange, thinks people trying to poison her

Cognitive assessment: orientated to location but not to day date month or year. concentration impaired.

high yield tests:
1. CT Brain
2. LUMBAR PUNCTURE --> anti-NMDA receptor antibodies
3. EEG - disorganised slowing and generalised activty --> encephalopathic picture
4. PELVIC ULTRASOUND --> find ovarian teratomas

explanation
- autoimmune phenomenon cross reactivity with NMDAR in brain and NMDAR in teratomas
- 80% cases are female
- median age of onset 21 years

treatment:
- remove tumour
- immunosuppression: steroids, Igg, plasmaphereis

Broadly before we had diagnosed the encephalitis we could say this woman had a __delirium__ due to her fluctuating confusion/cognition
- psychotic phenomena common

Causes of delirium: I-WATCH-DEATH
- also pain
- In 40% of cases a cause is not found

medications in dleirium: olanzapine 2.5-10mg TDS PO or IM; haloperidol 0.5mg TDS PO or IM (concern EPSEs).
- avoid benzos as they worsen the situation unless in EtOH or benzo withdrawal

PRESS syndrome:
- Encephalopathy secondary to very high blood pressure

thiamine dose in alcohol withdrawal = 300mg TDS IM initially then switch to oral.

2. Harold

Steroids --> mania

patients with epilepsy have increased incidence of

Keppra most likely anticolvulsant to cause psychosis.
Carbamazepime, sodium valproate, topimarate are all common psych meds; prescribed on and off label as mood stabilisers.

## Perinatal Mental Health

Transient anxiety and sadness are common but most women do not exprience major psychiatric problems.
- A baby is part of a relationship
- Social interactions in infancy --> early __attachments__ --> mental and emotional developments
  + Influences on attachment: maternal sensitivity, mother's attachment relationships, parental reflective functioning/mentalising capacity, mother's mind mindedness, representations by mother of herself as caregiver and of her child, infant temperament/capacity for self-regulation, __contextual factors__.

### Psychosocial Screening

Edinborough Perinatal Depression Scale - screening tool looks at the last week

### Scz and BPAD

Diagnosis usually predates pregnancy.

Impact of illness on:
- Planning Pregnancy
- Antenatal obstetric care
- Health of foetus
- Delivery and immediate post-delivery period
- Mother-infant relationship

Pregnancy itself impacts on maternal MH.


## Personality Disorders (incl. BPD)

### Topographic theory

Freud: tripartite structure of the psyche = Id + Ego + Superego
- Id = eros (sex) + thanatos (death). Biological inherited, impulsive, instinctive, primitive.
- Ego = that part of the Id which has been modified by direct influence of the external world.
- Superego = values and morals of society, learned.

### Borderline Personality Disorder

- AKA Complex PTSD
- Categorisation is unclear.
- __90-96%__ of people who have BPD have experienced sexual abuse, many of them as children. Some would argue 100%, and the 6-10% who have not its just undiagnosed.
  * It is easier to blame oneself for this and figure out how they can change themselves to stop it from ever happening again --> very often BPD patients _hate_ themselves.
  * Boundaries are important; boundaries are how we understand the world. One of the ways we understand our identity is by excluding identities we are not. BPD concepts of identity are perturbed - the boundary that a caregiver should not touch us sexually has been shattered --> dysfunctional boundary setting in the rest of their lives. Instead of healthy psychological boundaries, containment in the hospital becomes a surrogate physical boundary.
  * All this comes into trying to avoid institutionalising these patients by admitting them repetitively - even though they may want treatment to get them off the emotional rollercoaster which is BPD.
  * __Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)__ helps these patients to understand how to take care of themselves psychologically. It is _very_ long-term work and people need to want to do it.
+ __Splitting__ - this can be a defence mechanism (things we do subconsciously to make the psychological reality easier to bear)
  * In BPD things are very black and white: these patients struggle to experience the grey area.
  * Sometimes they can take this approach to relationships and see each in only good and bad terms: someone who does something nice for you is the good object; as soon as they mess up they are the bad object. Doctors are idealised until they totally aren't.
  * Practically, people start to walk on eggshells around BPD patients.

## Psychopharmacology

Contact Trevor Norman trevorrn@unimelb.edu.au

Use medications when the benefits outweigh the risks. >50% discontinue meds within 3 months: SEs, illness, communication issues, feeling better, fear of dependence

Textbook: fundamentals of clinical psychopharmacology

### Antidepressant Medications

Mechanism of action  
- "Monoamine hypothesis" = SSRIs block receptor reuptake of serotonin at the synapse. This is nonsensical and outdated!
  + We would expect a response time of hours to days, not weeks, if this were to be true
- Actual response to do with 2nd messenger pathways: upregulating cAMP causes increase in BDNP (brain-derived neurotrophic protein), promoting growth of neurons, reconnection
  + Lower BDNP on autopsy post-suicide than post-other deaths.
- Eventually, restoration of hippocampal volume.

How long do they take to work?
- For severe depression we can expect to see some improvement (e.g. an extra few hours of sleep/night) in 2-3 weeks
- 6-8 weeks needed for a more complete mood response

Medication is not the whole answer, but it can help you to feel ready to deal with stresses when they arise.

Suicide risk on antiDs: everyone asks this!
- The relative risk of suicide is increased however the absolute risk is still low.
- Some of the side effects which make people feel "insane" are internal restlessness, agitation, increased arousal - these are not permanent and we can give you valium to smooth the transition on to medication
- We will give you some numbers to call if you feel anything strange or different, that could lead to you thinking about harming yourself. Your GP is a good start, or a community mental health service.

Other side effects:
- General: nausea, headache
- __Mirtazapine__ notorious for weight gain

The medications are not addictive however some people experience __discontinuation symptoms__ - these come from missing doses as well as stopping medications altogether:
- General: headache, nausea, vomiting
- __Venlafaxine (effexor)__ and __paroxetine__ notorious for the feeling of electric shocks in the brain/body
  + Can cover these with diazepam
- Flu-like syndrome

"When can I come off the meds?"
- 12 months from the recovery of normal function is a good innings. If it was depression associated with an acute stressor now relieved, maybe less; if there are relapses, maybe more.

FIRST CASE: LOIS.

Here we have someone who has decompensated in the face of a major life stressor
- major worry is for a major depressive disorder
- if someone is sad or adjusting, they dont respond well to antidepressants
- mild depression responds best to talk therapy
- moderate - psycho + meds
- severe
  * melancholic: medication + psychotherapy +/- ECT
  * psychotic: medication +/- antipsychotics / ECT

choice of anitD
- usually start with escitalopram or sertraline 100mg daily
- low dose initially and up-titrate over three weeks
- if someone doesn't respond to 150 you aren't going to push it

phases
- acute phase: stabilise acute symptoms; symptom remission
- continuation: restoration of psychosocial funcitoning; prophylaxis ie prevention of relapse
- maintenance: prevention of a new episode or of recurrence

Duration of Rx __after remission__:
- 1st episode: continuation treatment for __at least 6-12 months__. taper gradually.
- 2 episodes within 5 years: at least 3 years maintenance Rx
- 3 or more episodes within 5 years: at least 5 years maintenance Rx
- Psychotic depression or serious suicide attempt may need longterm treatment

### Serotonin Syndrome

Either drug-drug interactions, or overdose of a single serotonergic drug. Manifestations range from mild to severe:
- Tremor
- Hyperreflexia
- Agitation
- Muscle rigidity
- Hyperthermia
- Diaphoresis
- Tachycadia
- Hypertension
- Myoclonus
- Mydriasis

### Antipsychotic Medications

Indications: the Rx of __psychotic symptoms__ in
-	Schizophrenia
-	Schizophreniform psychosis
-	Schizoaffective disorder
-	Delusional disorder
-	Brief reactive psychosis
-	Psychotic disorder NOS (atypical psychosis)
-	Bipolar disorder – hypomanic phase/depressed phase
-	Major depression with psychotic features
-	Delirium
-	Psychotomimetic drug ingestion

Tablet, IM, SL formulations
- Asenapine has SL: feels weird to take but it has to be SL for  bioavailability
- Depot injections: Risperidone Consta 25-50mg/2 weeks; Zuclopenthixol decanoate (Clopixol) 200-400mg/2-4 weeks IM has fewer side effects than the oral daily dose.
- Acuphase (zuclopenthixol acetate) to control acute psychosis in-hospital

These were discovered by chance! Chlorpromazine initially an antihistamine but found to be antipsychotic and sedative. Clozapine a related class – discovered in 1961, withdrawn in 1975 (fatal agranulocytosis) and rediscovered in 1980s. Second gen antipsychotics discovered in 1990s: amisulpride, olanzapine, quetiapine, disperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone. Aripiprazole found in 2000s.

MOA
-	All current 1st and 2nd line drugs antagonise the D2 receptor.
	+ Efficacy thought to be due to D2R agonism in the striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen)
	+ Psychosis ?assoc w/ increased DA presynaptic function in nigrostriatal pathway cf mesolimbic. ?downstream of a more primary abnormality in GABA or glutamate system.

Adverse events
-	__Extrapyramidal SEs__ with 1st generation – chlorpromazine, zuclopenthixol, haloperidol
  + Acute dystonia: oculogyric crisis, torticollis, tongue protrusion, facial grimacing
  + Drug-induced parkinsonism: muscular rigidity, resting tremor, akinesia
  + If persistent treat w/ DA agonist eg bromocriptine; theoretic risk of worsening psychotic symptoms.
  + Akathisia
  + Tardive syndromes; dyskinesia, dystonia, akathisia
  + Usually after months-years of treatment (“tardive”)
-	__Neuroleptic malignant syndrome__ (the serotonin syndome of antipsychotics)
  + 0.5-1% of patients, but severe
  + Muscular rigidity, decreased consciousness, hyperthermia, labine BP, increased creatine kinase rapidly evolving over 24-72h and lasting 10-14 days untreated
  + Mortality if untreated due to renal failure 2* to rhabdomyolysis
  + Management: withdraw antipsychotics. Dantrolene for muscle spasm. Bromocriptine to reverse anti-DA effects. ECT to activate DA systems. ICU. 2 week interval before reconsidering a structurally dissimilar antipsychotic to manage psych symptoms.
-	Atypical agents characterised by fewer EPSEs – clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, amisulpride. Aripiprazole is 3rd generation and a partial D2 agonist.
-	__Metabolic effects__ and weight gain
  + Weight gain & glucose dysregulation most associated with clozapine and olanzapine; to a lesser extent with all except for haloperidol
-	__Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular__ events
  + Sudden cardiac death
  + Ventricular tachyarrhhythmias: block K repolarisation current and prolong QT
  + Stroke – increased risk in patients with dementia treated with risperidone and olanzapine
  + Myocarditis, cardiomyopathy
-	Activating or sedating effects
  + Some people are restless and hyperaroused, others are sedated >> adjust timing of dose to nocte or mane
-	Hyperprolactinaemia – reduced with second generation/atypical
- __Gastrointestinal__ SEs
  + Constipation
  + Bowel perforation is the serious concern
  + Aperients to prevent

![Table of SEs of atypical antipsychotics](https://github.com/wollemia/md/blob/main/atypicals_SEs.png)

Treating psychosis: an __atypical__ agent should be __first line__. Try two then try olanzapine or clozapine.
-	Consider benzo for short-term sx relief: diazepam for agitation/aggression, loraz for anxiety, temaz for sleep disturbance
-	First try __aripiprazole 5mg/day targeting 15-20mg/day__, or brexpiprazole (new drug)
  + Aripiprazole doesn't work for everyone and makes some people restless.
-	Second try __quetiapine (Seroquel) 25-50mg/day targeting 300-400mg/day (max 750)__
  + <200mg/day anxiolytic, 300-600mg antidepressant, >600mg antipsychotic; BD regimen
  + Quetiapine works very well in mania/bipolar, but wouldn't rush to put people on it in scz unless they fail aripip
-	A “trial” should be low dose for 3 weeks --> assess and increase dose over next 3 weeks --> assess after 6-8 weeks total.
-	First signs of improvement: less aggressive, less irritable, less restless, improved sleep. Optimal benefits may take up to 6/52. RANZCP say 2-5 years of treatment after first episode, indefinite after second.
-	If failed 2 drugs and adherence not an issue, go to clozapine 50mg/day targeting 300-900mg/day.
  + Initial echo, ECG, FBE diff, prolactin – concern is agranulocytosis and

SECOND CASE: CHRONIC SCZ

medications are broken down by cyp450
smoking affects cytochrome p182 - which is the same guy who breaks down clozapine
- ceasing smoking can cause big variation in clozapine levels (30-50% variation)
- clozapine: cancer-like febrile neutropenia. cardiomyopathy. myocarditis. but actually most people die of constipation/perforation!
- risperidone: 1-2 increasing to 6mg daily. major SE is the prolactin elevation.

only 30% of pts who have 1st episode psychosis (UNTREATED) DON'T have another one???

if they get a good response: continue for 12-24 months, gradually taper and monitor and keep them on a low dose.

### factors in medication adherence

Disease
- disorganised thought and behaviour
- paranoid delusions
- hostility
- aggression
- cognitive impairment
Patient
Clinician
Family

monitor adherence regularly - collateral history is helpful
engage family in treatment
keep regimen simple
educate and involve the patient

### Mood Stabilisers

L

THIRD CASE: MANIA

initially treat the mania with an anitpsychotic (choose quetiapine) while the mood stabiliser ramps up
- quetiapine antihistamine effects can knock some people out
- some BPAD patients do well on quetiapine alone
- some need Li + quetiapine
- antipsychotics help with the upside (mania) but not so much with the downside (depression)

if they tick over into depression
- consider increasing Li into the 0.7-1 dose range
- consider another mood stabiliser: lamotrigine (stevens johnsons major worry)
- valproate used to be used a lot; causes spina bifida in kids at pre high rates. can worsen PCOS.
- consider adjusting the adjunct antipsychotic
- introducing an antidepressant is controversial as it can cause rapid cycling bipolar; some say its OK if under cover of an antipsychotic

the long and short of it is, presentation and treatment of bipolar is VERY diverse
- many bipolar patients enjoy their hypomanic phase

### Anxiolytic medications

short-acting benzodiazepines while u start an antiD; combine with lifestyle, CBT, breathing exercises

## Psychotherapy in clinical practice

Successful when there is a good _therapeutic alliance_ between dr and patient: a tacit agreement or contract which supports the treatment.

Transference = patient projects feelings about someone else (particularly someone from their past) onto their dr

Countertransference = doctor's feelings in response to the patient's transference onto them.


### CBT for Anxiety



### CBT for Depression

## Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders

-	Psychosis: impaired sense of reality
-	Schizophrenia = long-term psychosis
	 + 2 symptoms for 1 month, with 5 months prodromal or residual symptoms
-	Drug-induced psychosis >> stop taking meds >> continues >> reduced chance of returning to ‘normal’ >> chronic schizophrenia

X = distressing

| POSITIVE SYMPTOMS         | NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| X Hallucinations          | No Motivation         |
| X Delusions               | Flat affect           |
| Disorganised speech       | Functional impairment |
| Disorganised or catatonic | Cognitive decline     |
|                           |                       |
| Antipsy reduce severity   | 5 As                  |

5 As of negative sx: affective flattening, alogia (lack of speech), anhedonia, avolition (no motivation), asociality.


### Aetiology

-	Stress-vulnerability model
-	Obstetric, drug abuse, poverty/low SES, urban, immigrants/minorities, life events, family effect

### Types of Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia if symptoms for 1 month and signs of disturbance for 6. Else, psychosis NOS.

-	Paranoid: delusions and auditory hallucinations predominate. “High-functioning” schizophrenic. Persecutory beliefs – eg believe they are being watched.
-	Disorganised: “Poor-functioning”, more negative symptoms and disorganised thoughts.
-	More rare – Catatonic: resists instructions, rigid posture. Requires >2 of these 5 – immobility, purposeless activity, extreme negativism or mutism, peculiar voluntary movements, echolalia (repeat what others say) or echopraxia (repeat others’ actions).
-	Undifferentiated: any of the above combined
-	Residual: prominent negative or attenuated positive symptoms only

### Other Psychotic Diagnoses

-	‘Delusional disorder’: non-bizarre delusions only. No hallucinations, no thought disorder, mood disorder, affect flattening. E.g. old ladies who think the neighbours are ‘out to get them.’ Relatively functional. Hard to treat, anti-psychotics not as effective… ‘try to distract them’ (- Matthew)
-	Brief psychotic disorder: >1 day, < 1 month, at least 1 of 4 positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Full recovery.
-	Schizophreniform: ‘pre-schizophrenia’. 1 month to <6 months. Not necessarily dysfunctional.
-	Schizoaffective: sx for 2 weeks to 1 month. ‘Mixed’ schizophrenia and mood disorder.
-	We can also find psychotic symptoms in organic diosrders, mood disorders, dissociative disorders, other mental health conditions, and within normal experience

### First Presentation Psychosis

GOTO: Notecards!

First think – IS IT DRUGS?
-	Intoxication
-	Withdrawal

Initial assessment
-	Physical exam
-	Neurological exam
-	Full blood count and ESR
-	UEC and CMP
-	LFTs
-	Fasting glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides
  + Antipsychotic meds have metabolic SEs

### Schniederian First-Rank Symptoms of Schizophrenia

-	Auditory hallucinations:
  + Thought echo
  + Voices commenting on one’s actions
  + Voices talking among themselves
  + The above three are quite specific for schizophrenia
-	Thoughts:
  + Thought insertion
  + Thought withdrawal
  + Thought broadcasts
-	Somatic passivity: something else ‘makes’ them do things/actions
-	Delusions of control (emotions and impulses)
-	Delusional perception: normal percept and delusional interpretation (e.g. I see this dressing gown which means I’m dead).

### Outcome predictors

Predictors of a good outcome:
- Sociodemographic
  + Married
  + Female
- Premorbid
  + No previous psych history
  + No premorbid personality problems
  + Good social relations
  + Good work and educational record
- Clinical
  + Acute onset
  + Stressful situational precipitant
  + Older at age of onset
  + Short episode
  + Florid psychotic presentation
  + Good initial response to medication
  + COntinued use of medication
  + Absence of ventricular enlargement or sulcal widening
  + Good neuropsychological functioning

### Treatment

-	Anti-psychotics
	+ __1st generation (typical)__: Extrapyramidal side effects __EPSEs__. Rarely, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (autonomic NS failure). Metabolic syndrome. Haloperidol, chlorpromazine most common; less common now are zuclopenthixol and flupenthixol (both sedating)
	+ 2nd & 3rd generation (__atypical__): __preferred now__. Fewer extrapyramidal and more metabolic side effects. Clozapine – best. Olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone – very sedating, weight gain. 3rd gen aripiprazole, brexpiprazole – weak but fewer side effects. Paliperidone – moderate.
	+ Prolonged QT – >500ms is concerning. Quite common. ECG on arrival.
	+ Some can be given as long-acting injections (‘depots’) 1/month – aripip, paliperi, olanzapine. Good if non-compliant.
	+ Ideally just use one but many need multiple.
	+ Zuclupenthixol acetate (Acuphate): emergency psych drug, high intensity over a day or so.
-	Anti-depressants: not typically helpful, unless having prominent mood fluctuations
-	Mood stabilisers: valproate for emotional/violent/schizoaffective.

## Substance Use Disorders

### Features by DSM-V

![Diagnoses assocaited with substance class](https://github.com/wollemia/md/blob/main/substanceDiagnoses.png)

- Does not separate abuse and dependence.
- Criteria provided with severity judged based on how mnay criteria met.

Broadly, the features:

1. The disorder represents clinically significant symptomatic presentation of a relevant mental disorder
2. There is evidence from hx, physical, or labs of
  + Disorder developed during or within 1/12 of a substance intoxication or withdrawal or takingf a medication;
  + The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the mental disorder
3. The disorder is not better explained by an independent mental disorder. Evidence may include:
  + the disorder preceded the onset of severe intoxication/withdrawal/exposure
  + The full mental disorder persisted after cessation of withdrawal or intoxication
4. Not delirium
5. Disorder causing distress or functional impairment

"Early remission" <3 and >12 months --> "sustained remission" >12 months without meeting criteria except craving.

### Criteria for diagnosis

2-3: Mild substance use disorder
4-5: Moderate
6+: Severe

1. Taking the substance in __larger amounts__ or __over a longer period__ than you meant to
2. __Wanting to cut down__ but being unable to do so.
3. Spending lots of __time obtaining, using, recovering___ from use
4. __Cravings__ and urges to use the substance
5. __Failure to fulfil obligations__ at work, school home
