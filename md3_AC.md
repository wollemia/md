## Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment

Extras cf. long case: explicit collateral history from family, explicit cognitive testing; explicit inclusion of nursing and allied health assessments

* Restate common geriatric syndromes
* Understand rationale and purpose of CGA
* Key components of CGA and assessment tools
* ID role of allied health
* Key sources of info for a CGA
* Describe differences in examination for people with CI
* How chronic diseases impact patients' lives

### Geriatric syndromes

* Instability
* Immobility
* Incontience
* Intellectual declines:
* Iatrogenesis
* Functional decline
* Pressure ulcers
* Dizziness

__Frailty__ (Fried's criteria) = unintentional weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slow walking speed, low physical activity
* Pre-frail: 1-2 criteria
* Frail: >= 3 criteria

### CGA process

1. Targeting appropriate patients

Some are too sick to benefit (long-term needs are not influenced by a CGA); others are too well to benefit (outcomes are not influenced by a CGA).

Appropriate for CGA:
* __Recent onset__ physical or cognitive impairment
* Changing physical and/or cognitive status
* Multiple __interacting problems amenable to treatment__
* __Fragmented__ specialty medical care
* Disorders __requiring rehabilitation__ therapy
* Consideration of __change in living situation__
* Evaluating competency/capacity
* Dealing with medico-legal issues

2. (a) Assessing

Collecting information from 4 sources: (1) self-reported; (2) collateral history; (3) direct observation of function; (4) medical records & MDT input
* Members of the __MDT__: hospital medical, GP, nursing, physiotherapy, OT, social work, neuro/clinical psychology, podiatry, speech pathology, dietetics
* __Self-reporting may be compromised__: acute illness, impaired cognition, impaired communication (TLC, deafness, english proficiency), depression, fear of consequences, rationalisation, cultural issues
* Emotional language to describe functionality:
  + Spectrum from less independent to more independent
  + Frail, exhausted, ready to die
  + Not coping, losing control, vulnerable
  + Struggling, frustrating, difficult
  + Slowing down, feeling tired
  + "Good" for my age
* Collateral from: family, carers, GP. Not always accurate; based on observed performance; limited by discomfort/embarrassment, health literacy, awareness of or exposure to current status
* Direct observation: usually by allied health. Best for assessing physical function. More accurate than self report or collateral history.
  + __Capacity vs performance__: what they can do, rather than what they actually do.
  + Reasons for under-performance: unwell/fatigue, afraid, lack of need, lack of suitable aids or modifications, executive dysfunction.

Medical assessment
* Problem list including comorbidities and disease severity
* Medication review
* Nutrition, dentition

Functional assessment
* ADLs: personal, domestic, community; functional independence measure (FIM); Barthel's
* Balance and gait: Timed Up and Go (TUG); Sternal push/Pastor test
* Continence: continence charts; bladder diary; urodynamics  

Neuropsychological
* Cognition: 4AT (assessment test for delirium and cognitive impairment); sMMSE (dementia); MoCA; FAB (frontal assessment battery)
* Mood: geriatric depression scale (GDS)

Social
* Living arrangements
* Supports (formal, informal)

Environmental
* Home safety
* Transport/community access

Beliefs and values
* Religion/spirituality
* Sexuality/intimacy
* End of life care

Challenges:
* Atypical presentation of disease
* Lack of sensitivity and specificity of investigations
* Goals of care
* Agism/nihilism from health professionals, family, carers, patients

2. (b) Developing recommendations



3. Implementing recommendations



## Cognitive assessment

Diagnosis <--> treatment <--> prognosis

* Safety concerns: medication management, driving
* Future planning

DDx for cognitive impairment
* Dementia: Cognitive impairment in one or more cognitive domains (__learning and memory__, __language__, __executive function__, complex __attention__, __perceptual-motor__, __social cognition__) impacting function. Prevalence doubles every 5 years between the age of 68 and 90. AD, FTD, VD. Common to have more than 1 cause.
* Delirium: acute onset confusional state w/ fluctuating course.
* Focal brain lesions w/ specific neurological & cognitive deficits.

### History taking

* Timeline
* Memory: events/names, appointments/plans, losing things, repeated conversations, unable to learn new skills
* Visuospatial: orientation, getting lost, driving
* Reasoning, judgement, problems solving: unable to cope with unexpected events, easily overwhelmed
* Language: word-finding, mixing languages
* Complex tasks: meds, finances
* Previously well-known household tasks: cooking, woodworking, sewing
* Personality or behavioural changes: sundowning, wandering, self-care, sleep
* Neuropsychiatric: mood changes, irritability, agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, delusions

IQ Code: ask an informant, compared to 10 years ago, how is this person's...

Risk factors on history:
* Vascular: stroke, TIA, hypertension, DM, lipids, IHD, AF, PVD, smoking
* General anaesthetic
* Head trauma
* DOA
* Malignancy
* Family history: dementia, vascular disease
* Neurodegenerative: anosmia, REM sleep behaviour disorder
* OSA

Medications:
* Benzos
* Anticholinergics
* Analgesics

Social history and others:
* Personal history: birth, schooling, language, occupations, relationships, retirement
* Driving; problems, distances, accidents, family concerns, limitations
* Finances
* Will, EPOA, ACD, ACAS

### Examination

General obs

Parkinsonism

Neurological exam: lateralising signs previous stroke

Vision

Cortical signs: graphaesthesia, dyscalculia, finger agnosia, LR disorientation

Primitive reflexes

AD exam generally normal

CVD exam

ECG for treatment purposes

### Tools

MoCA

Stroop colour words test

## Death

### Being asked to declare a death

Ask over the phone:
1. Was the death expected or unexpected?
2. Are the family present, and if so, how are they doing (grieving, quiet shock, anger)?
3. Has anyone else been notified?

If the death was unexpected, head straight to the room to find out whether the patient is actually dead. Patients may appear dead if not examined thoroughly:
* Severe hypogthermia
* Ingestion of drugs or alcohol
* Hypoglycaemic coma
* Prolonged apnoeic episodes in the terminal phase of death

### Examination

1. Confirm ID
2. Sensitively check for response to painful stimuli - nail bed pressure, trapezius squeeze, sternal rub.
3. Can check absence of pupillary reflexes
4. Listen and observe for breath sounds for 2 minutes
5. Palpate pulse and auscultate chest, checking heart sounds are absent for 2 minutes.
6. Finally check whether there are implantable pacemakers or defibrillators, which will be required on cremation certificates.

In reporting the exam, record: time called, who was present, 5 cardinal features to verify death, time of death, probable cause of death, whether the coroner was notified, whether the treating team/consultant was notified, whether the GP was notified.

### Deaths Reportable to the Coroner

State-specific. In Victoria:
* Unexpected, unnatural, violent, or have resulted directly or indirectly from accident or injury, even if it occurred years or decades previously
* During a medical procedure
* Following a procedure where the death was not expected prior to the procedure
* 'Held in custody or care' before the death:
  + Police custody or jail, even if not arrested
  + Drug and alcohol rehabilitation
  + Patient under the Mental health Act
  + Care of the Department of Human Services
* Unable to sign a death certificate
* Identity unknown

Case: A 92 year-old man with advanced dementia has a fall resulting in a sub-dural haemorrhage. Prior to the injury he was doubly incontinent, fully dependent for his personal care, only mobilised short distances with assistance and did not recognise his family. After discussion with his family and neruosurgeons a decision is made not to operate and he dies 3 days later.
* This death __is reportable to the coroner__ as it is the result of a fall/trauma, even though the treatment plan has been agreed upon. Coroner after discussion may decide autopsy is not required and death certificate can be completed.


## Dementia

2nd leading cause of mortality & 1st in Women
* 1st cause of mortality in >65 yos

Normal ageing:
* Slower __thought processes and reaction times__: particularly affects working memory, while sustained attention - vigilance - is preserved
* Reduced efficiency __retrieving memories__: episodic memory affected while semantic memory preserved.
* Occasional word finding difficulties
* May rely on prior knowledge, experience and expert opinion to make decisions

vs

Dementia (DSM-V): evidence of __significant cognitive decline__ from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains (__learning and memory, language, executive function, complex attention, perceptual-motor, social cognition__)
* Cognitive deficits interfere with everyday activities (ADLs eg paying bills, managing medication)
* Not exclusively in the context of a delirium
* Not better explained by another mental disorder

vs

MCI: mild neurocognitive disorder with subjective memory complaints __without interfering with ADLs__
* 10% risk per year of progressing to dementia

Risk factors:
* Early life: less education
* Mid life: hypertension, obesity, hearing loss, diabetes
* Late life: smoking, depression, physical and cognitive inactivity

Aetiology:
* Alzheimer's disease
* VaD
* Lewy body
* FTD
* Mixed AD and VaD

Other DDx:

* Metabolic: diabetes, thyroid disease, parathyroid disease, Cushing disease, Addison's disease

### Alzheimer's disease

Memory impairment early --> executive dysfunction and visuospatial impairment follow. Later, language and behavioural symptoms.
* __Early-onset AD__ is autosomal dominant, where half the family get AD before age 50.

Anticholinesterase inhibitors the usual pharma management
* Donepezil
* Galantamine
* Rivastigmine
* AchE have a terrible
Memantine is second line either alone or in combination with an AchE

### Vascular dementia

VaD is a spectrum from a single stroke thru to multiple small infarcts or multiple large strokes. Two common types: multi-infarct dementia & Binswanger disease.
* __Multi-infact dementia__: most common type.
  + Sx of severe depression, mood swings, seizures.
  + Likely to have better insight earlier on than people with Alzheimer's.
* Binswanger's disease (aka Subcortical Vascular dementia): thought to be rare but being reassessed.
  + White matter deep in brain is affected.
  + Sx of slowess, lethargy, emotional ups and downs, difficulty walking, lack of bladder control
  + Strong association w/ past or present HTN
  + Can be caused by a single large stroke
* Frontal lobe dysfunction earlier and memory impairment later?
* Gait impairment and neurological sequelae
* CADISIL is an important cause of stroke in the young

### Lewy Body Dementia

Lewy bodies = eosinophilic introcytoplasmic inclusions in deep brain matter containing alpha synuclein
* Difficulty with concentration and attention, extreme confusion, difficulty judging distances --> __Falls common__
* 2/3 cardinal symptoms required:
  + Visual hallucinations (DONT GIVE ANTIPSYCHOTICS)
  + Parkinsonism (tremors, stiffness)
  + Fluctuating mental state over minutes to hours, not due to underlying physical illness.
* In LBD, __parkinsonism occurs within 12 months of the dememntia or prior__, cf. __PD dementia which occurs many years after the appearance of a movement disorder__.
* Sensitive to neuroleptic medications

### Frontotemporal dementia

Affects a younger age group. 3 variants = behavioural variant, non-fluent primary progressive aphasia, semantic primary progressive aphasia. Associated with some forms of motor neuron disease.
* __BvFTD__: most common. Some become apathetic, others become very disinhibited.
  + Fixed mood and behaviour, selfish, not adaptible
  + Loss of empathy, emotional warmth
  + Apathy, amotivations, abandoning hobbies, avoiding social contact
  + Loss of inhibitions, talking to strangers, exhibiting embarassing behaviour
  + Difficulty reasoning, judgement, organisation, planning
  + Distractibility and impulsiveness
  + Changes in eating patters, craving sweet foods, overeating, unusual food preferences
  + Decline in self-care, personal hygiene
  + ADLs impaired early. Later, obsessions, repetitive movement/behavioural patterns.
* __Semantic dementia__: __nondominant temporal lobe__ form of FTD.
  + Ability to assign meaning to words is gradually lost.
  + Reading, spelling, comprehension, and expression are affected.
  + May have difficulty recognising previously familiar people.
  + Later in course as the dse spreads to the frontal lobes, changes in emotional responses, empathy and food preferences are common.
  + Progressive supranuclear palsy signs
* __Progressive non-fluent aphasia__ (PNFA; language dementia): dominant temporal lobe; least common form of FTD.
  + Ability to speak fluently gradually lost. Slow and difficult word production, speech distortion, tendency to produce the wrong word.
  + Slurring in some; in others, articulation is fine but word finding not.
  + Understanding of word meaning is preserved. Following conversations is difficult. Using telephone and communicating with groups of people particularly difficult.
  + Subtle deficits in problem solving, mental flexibility, decision making.
  + Later dse behavioural changes, empathy, emotinal responses affects.

![FTD Clinical Variants](md3_images/FTDvariants.png)

Dx FTD from depression by the absence of depressive cognitions (worthlessness, burdensome, guilt)  in FTD.

Dx FTD from mania by the absence of affective component in FTD. Mania more likely to need less sleep vs still needing sleep in FTD.

Dx from Scz by absence of auditory hallucinations and complex delusions in FTD.

Management:
* No cure or disease modifying Rx
* Education pt and family

### Other causes of dementia

Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH): triad of gait abnormality (ataxia/apraxia), dementia (mild to moderate, emphasis on executive impairment), urinary urgency/incontinence.
* Imaging: enlarged lateral ventriclaes with little or no cortical atrophy. Box-carred Sylvian fissures (appearing propped open) can be mistaken for perisylvian atrophy.
  + Crowding of dorsal frontal-parietal gyri dx from PSP (progressive supranuclear palsy) and CBD, where dorsal atrophy and suclal widening is common.
* NPH is a communicating hydrocephalus w/ a patent aqueduct of Sylvius
  + Cf. aqueductal stenosis
* LP opening pressure in high-normal range
* CSF, protein, cell counts, glucose all normal

Intracranial hypotension: low CSF pressure --> downward pressure on subcortical structures & disruption of cerebral function.
* Headache, dizziness, vomiting, disruption of sleep wake cycles
* Idiopathic, CSF leaks 2* to LP, head trauma, SC arachnoid cysts.

Wernicke encephalopathy: Vit B1 (thiamine) deficiency
* Malnourished patient, confusion, ataxia, diplopia
  + Inflammation and necrosis of periventricular midline structures incl. the dorsomedial thalamus, mammillary bodies, midline cerebellum, periaqueductal grey matter, trochlear and abducens nucleli.
  + Damage to __dorsomedial thalamus__ correlates most closely w/ __memory loss__
* Thiamine 100mg IV for 3 days --> daily oral dosage may reverse the disease.
* Prolonged untreated --> Korsakoff syndrome

Korsakoff syndrome: unable to recall new information despite normal immediate memory, attention span, level of consciousness.
* Easily confused, disoriented, cannot store information BUT may be superficially conversant, engaging and able to perform simple tasks and follow immediate commands.
* Confabulation common.
* No specific treatment: thiamine deficiency has cause irreversible damage to medial thalamic nuclei and mammillary bodies. MRI may show mammillary body atropy.

Vitamin B12 deficiency: megaloblastic anaemia + nervous system damage.
* Causes: vegan diet, autoimmunity vs gastric parietal cells (intrinsic factor deficiency), malabsorbtion, drugs (histamine blockers, metformin)
* Commonly a spinal cord syndrome (myelopathy) affecting __posterior columns__ (vibration and proprioception) + __corticospinal tracts__ (hyperactive tendon reflexes with Babibski signs)
* Peripheral nerve damage (neuropathy) --> sensory loss + depressed tendon reflexes.
* Dementia via damage to myelinated axons.
* Mechanism ?related to S-adenosyl methionine deficiency --> abnormal substrates for fatty acid synthesis in myelin.

Paraneoplastic encephalitis w/ NDMA receptor antibodies:
* Progresssive psych disorder w/ memory loss + seizures
* Often young women w/ ovarian teratoma.

Chronic metal exposure
* Lead: pottery glazes. Water sources.
  + Fatigue, depression, confusion. Episodic abdominal pain. Peripheral neuropathy.
  + Grey lead lines in gums
  + Anaemia with basophilic stippling of RBCs
  + Urine porphyrins may be elevated
  + Rx = chelation therapy w/ EDTA

* Early sx: personality change, social instability, paranoia, delusions.
* Later: memory loss, full-blown dementia, parkinsonian signs, ataxia, intention tremor.
* Tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles.

### Behavioural and Psychiatric Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD)

BPSD are common and distressing
* Context: community outreach, manage caregivers as well as patients
* Most BPSD remit over time - treatments now may not be required months from now
* Try non-drug therapies first:
  + Investigate possible delirium
  + BMT: ID social or environmental stressors --> progressively lower stress threshold. Good sleep hygiene.
  + Reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, reality orientation therapy.
  + Re-orientation to home (walk around the block and back inside, "we're home").
  + Capitalise on the patient's residual strengths.
  + Dementia Behavioural Management Advisory Service resource
* AVOID RESTRAINTS
* If antipsychotic is required: explain the risks and benefits to family and patient. 0.25mg to 2mg (max) risperidone with careful daily monitoring for sedation, Parkinsoninsm and falls. R/v after 12 weeks and reduce if sx have settled.

### Taking a dementia history

Trying to assess each of the cognitive domains thru a carer:
1. Learning and memory
  + Trouble picking up new things eg phone?   make sure to check what baseline would have been.
2. Language
3. perceptual and motor function
4. Social function
5. Complex attention
  + able to task switch?
  + Able to cope with changes in routine?
  + easily overwhelmed?
6. Executive function
  + managing finances
  + needing help at home

Risk factors
* Age
* Family history
* Social withdrawal / low intellectual stimulation?
* visual and hearing impairments
* Smoking
* CVD
* Diabetes
* Alcohol
* Low physical activity
* Depression
* ABI

## Depression in the elderly

Geriatric depression score



## Falls

You want to characterise why someone fell, and what puts them at risk of falling again.
* History of falls
* Medications: worst are benzodiazepines, SSRIs, sedatives and hypnotics. Polypharmacy also bad. Check BP and doses of  antihypertensives. Don't forget EtOH.
* Gait and balance
  + Balance assessment options, from less disabled to more disabled: [movements during gait, distractions; step test; functional reach; sternal push] = dynamic; [step stance/single limb stance; clinical test of sensory integration of balance (CTSIB); static stance] = static
* Cognition
* Lower limb joint function
* Neurological impairment
* Muscle strength
* HR and rhythm
* Postural hypotention
* Feet and footwear
* Environmental hazards

If head trauma, neurology, anticoagulation, consider CT brain.


### Gait disturbances

Break into low-level, mid level and high level gait disorders.

### Management

Cochrane r/v of falls management at home:
* Decrease the risk of falls: exercise programs, home safety interventions if visually impaired, primary care prescribing modification, Vit D if deficient
* Decrease the rate of falls: exercise program, home safety interventions if visually impaired, first cataract surgery, pacemaker, anti-slip shoes, psychotropic removal, unifocal glasses.
* No impact: HRT, home safety interventions, use of gait aid.
* May increase falls: vision correction in the first month, education, nutritional supplements, hip protectors.

## Hip fractures

### Assessment and pain management

Delirium is major risk which needs managing at this point:
* Actively look for cognitive impairment at first presentation with hip #
* Reassess pts to ID delirium arising during admission
* Delirium management basics: pain management, infection, familiar voices, low-stimulus envoironment, antipsychotics (haloperidol or olanzapine).

Assess pain _on presentation_ and _within 30 minutes of initial analgesia_ and _hourly until settled on the ward_ and _as part of routine obs_.
* Offer immediate analgesia to everyone including those with CI - allows movements for investigations, nursing care, rehab.

### Imaging

Everyone should get __AP and lateral X-rays__. MRI if # is suspected despite negative XRs of an adequate standard. If MRI is not available within 24h or is contraindicated, consider CT.

### Initial assessment

* Orthopaedic assessment
* Geriatric assessment if > 65
* Identify early multidisciplinary rehab goals (endgame is recover mobility and independence, return to pre-fracture residence, long-term wellbeing)
* Coordinated ortho, geri and MDT review
* Palliative surgery
  + If the # complicates or precipitates terminal illness surgery can be considered as part of the palliative approach if it _minimises pain and other symptoms_ and _facilitates patients rehab priorities_ and _aligns with patients wishes re. end of life care_

### Types of Hip Fracture and Surgical Management

Intra-capsular fractures: femoral head # (rare), subcapital neck #, transcervical neck #
* Displaced intracapsular --> total hip replacement or hemiarthroplasty or ORIF
  + Prefer THR over hemi in patients who could walk out of doors with SPS or better, not cognitively impaired, medically fit
  + Prefer hemi in patients who are less mobile or cognitively impaired
  + Prefer ORIF w/ cannulated screws in younger patients who need the hip for longer - preserve the natural femoral head if blood supply remains intact despite #.
* Major concern w/ intracap is __avascular necrosis of the femoral head__
  + Blood supply to the head: (1) medial and lateral circumflex branch of profunda femoris (plus its  perforating branches), (2) ligamentum teres artery descending from obturator artery, (3) arteries inside the bone itself.
* Non-displaced intracapsular --> in-situ pinning OR in few cases conservative management
* Femoral head # (<1%, usu high velocity impact) --> limited WB and nonsurgical Mx OR remove fragment OR ORIF OR if drastic and an older patient, replace hip.

Extra-capsular fractures: intertrochanteric, subtrochanteric
* __Inter-trochanteric__ --> __sliding compression hip screw__ (compression screw fixed to femoral shaft + lag screw through the plate into femoral head and neck) or intramedullary nail
  + NICE guidelines prefer sliding screw to nail
* Isolated # of the greater trochanter --> protected WB with crutches or walker
* Subtrochnteric # --> intramedullary nail


### Recovery from hip surgery

Start physical therapy out of bed the day after surgery: prevent medical cx, disorientation, deconditioning.

SMART rehabilitation goals in each allied health area.
* OT: self-care tasks (showering, dressing), what aids/equipment do they need for these
* Physiotherapy: mobilising (strength + ROM), transfers (independent/1 assist/2 assist)
* Medical: DVT prophylaxis (RACP says clexane, surgeons say aspirin is OK), wound care (leave dressings/stitches in until "wound check" appt), hip precautions, avoid pressure sores.
  + Consider new Dx osteoporosis if minimal trauma # --> start denosumab, check vitamin D, baseline DEXA scan can be done outpatient.

Benefits of d/c home: no further disruption to work, everyday life, no risk of hospital-acquired deconditioning. Full PT and OT assessment and safety optimisation can be done but more slowly.

Hip precautions for 12 weeks: avoid bending >90 deg, avoid internal/external rotation, avoid crossing legs.
* Encourage sitting with hips higher than knees, chair w armrest, sleep with pillow between legs.


## Legal Aspects of ageing

Ageing ~ incidence of medical conditions affecting someone's ability to make decisions about financial, medical and lifestyle matters.

Advance care planning is the process of discussing all this with a patient:

Medical Treatment pLaning and Decisions act 2016
* Victorians can creat a legally binding advanced care directive (ACD)
  * Instructinoal directive/refusal of treatment certificate
  * Values directive
  * Appoint a medical treatment decision maker (MTDM - previously called EPOA) who can make decisions to consent to or refuse the treatment
  * Guardian appointed with specific medical powers

NOK hierarchy in absence of an appointed MTDM: first is spouse, second is primary carer (long-term continuing relationship), then kids, parents, siblings. Requirement is a close and continuing relationship with the patient.

If someone is completely on their own:
* Is the proposed treatment significant?
* If so, must go to VCAT
* If insignificant (routine, no bodily intrusion, no risk of side effects, non-psychotropic medications) can proceed without consent.

If treatment is significant but it is an emergency situation, doctors can proceed.
* Must NOT proceed if you know the pt has refused that particular treatment in an instructional directive within an ACD/medical certificate before 2018

Palliative care (reasonable provision of pain relief, and of food and water) is different
* People cannot demand but they can negotiate
* Parenteral feeding is considered a medical treatment
* People CAN include statements about pall care in their values directive.

* Denosumab
* Bisphosphanates
* Oestrogen replacement?


## Pain

### Investigations

Re-staging scan

Blood tests
* CMP if hypercalcaemia a concern

### Management

Two-armed approach: control the pain itself, and control the underlying disease.

### Primary analgaesics

* Most opioids metabolised by the liver.
* In __renal impairment__:
  + Fentanyl best - most metabolites from the liver are inactive and will not cause problems at the kidney
  + Hydromorphone next best in renal impairment - fewer side effects. Tend to use a smaller dose in people with low eGFRs.
  + eGFR below 50 start thinking to use fentanyl or hydromorphone
* In __liver impairment__:
  + Fentanyl also best. Does not require much residual liver function to carry out metabolism.
  + Oxycodone, hydromorphone also good
* Targin no good in liver impairment - the naloxone stays active too long and kills the opioid effect.
* Opioid rotation: rotate the route or convert to another opioid.
* Long-acting form for more even pain relief
* Rule for breakthrough dose: individual dose is 1/6 of the total daily dose of medication. No limit to maximum breakthrough doses a patient can have.
  + Long-acting morpine MScontin. 15mg bd --> 30mg total in 24h --> breakthrough dose is 5mg. If someone is taking 4 breakthrough doses, increase the total background dose to 50mg in 24h --> breakthrough dose increase to 8mg.

Morphine
* Oral and injectible forms
* Oral forms are long-acting and short-acting.
  + MSContin (lasts 12h --> BD dosing), Kapanol (lasts up to 24h --> can dose OD or BD, BD is better): long-acting controlled release forms
  + Ordine (liquid form oral morphine - lasts 3-4h), Severdol (3-4 h): short-acting oral forms.
* Convert oral to subcutaneous morphine by dividing by 3.

Oxycodone
* Short acting forms: Oxynorm, Endone. Both last ~4h.
* CR long-acting forms: Oxycontin (12h - dose BD), Targin
* Convert oral to subcut oxycodone by dividing by 2: 1mg subcut = 2mg oral.
* Rotate oxycodone to another opioid: find morphine dose equivalence. 1.5x as strong as morphine --> if someone on 5mg oxycodone this is equivalent to 7.5mg morphine.

Hydromorphone
* Short acting: dilaudid lasting 2h.
* Long-acting: Jurnista, lasting 24h OD dosing.
* Ratio oral to subcut is 3.5.
* Opioid rotation: conversion ratio to morphine is 5 (hydromorphone is 5x as strong as morphine).
  + 20-30% discount of dose when rotating to counter the tolerance to whatever they were on previously

Methadone
* Oral and subcutaneous forms
* Opioid + NMDA receptor antagonist (NMDA increases effectiveness of pain signal transmission --> block it to feel less pain). Reset the pain threshold.
* Add small dose methadone to existing opioid - use NMDARA characteristic to break vicious pain cycle
* Can also replace existing opioid dose with methadone alone, but dosing is complex.
* No specific conversion ratio between methadone and other opioids - nonlinear. Someone previously on a lot of opioid may not need much methadone to achieve adequate pain control.
* Oral to subcut ratio is 2.
* Nonlinear duration of action: when taken as individual dose if methadone-naive usually lasts 6-8h. Becomes longer acting when someone is taking regularly.

Buprenorphine patch
* Less commonly used in palliative care setting
* Change every 7d
* Not useful for rapid uptitration when pain is unstable
* Better when pain is chronic and stable in intensity
* 5mcg/h form is equivalent to 5mg subcut morphine over 24h
* Can be used in opioid naive

Fentanyl patch
* Change every 72h (3 days)
* 12mcg/h equivalent to 15mg SC morphine in 24h --> less good for opioid naive.
* Abstral - short acting fentanyl tablet under tongue.
  + Use for incident pain, dressing change, showering, etc - last an hour, half an hour

### Adjuvant analgaesics

Amitryptilline

Duloxetine

Carbemazepine is still the gold standard for trigeminal neuralgia
* No RCTs for other types of neuropathic pain

Pregabalin & gabapentin
* GABA analogue
* Opposite of NDMA: GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter
* Pregabalin is BD dosing rather than TDS for gabapentin
* Dose modulate in renal impairment

Ketamine
* NMDARA
* Circuit breaker - short course of 5-7 days to reset the pain threshold and help out the other analgaesics
* RCT several years ago re. use of ketamine in palliative care put much of the benefit down to placebo
* Methadone is probably more first-line
* Proven superior benefit in ischaemic leg - tissues going thru necrosis release particular neurotransmitters which the ketamine helps combat

Dexamethasone
* Inflammatory pain
* brain mets, liver mets, spinal cord mets

Baclofen: skeletal muscle pain
Hyoscine: smooth muscle relaxant relieve bowel pain
Bisphosphanates: hypercalacemia in multiple myeloma

### Treat the underlying disease

Chemotherapy: reduce tumour load
RTx: more potent local
Surgery if a patiet is well enough: debulking tumour
Nerve block:: pancreatic Ca. Celiac plexus block. Short-term measures.
Ascitic tap

## Palliative care

### Thinking time

Some people say modern Western society is death denying, or death-avoidant. Find two pieces of evidence to support and two to refute this argument.

In the for camp/we are in denial about death:
* In my own experience with Anna, no one wanted to say that her time was up, when we probably all knew it was. She was 1-2 weeks away from dying and though we knew this in our hearts, the discussion was still around treatment, experimental chemo, compassionate use of medications, some far-off drugs from America. Through David I kept getting "a couple of months" as the prognosis. I remember a phone call with mum where she asked me, "should I just come?" and I said, yes, its time.
*

In the against camp (we are not in denial about death):
* Once the agreement or decision to transition to palliative care had been made in Anna's case, things got easier. Her wishes, to die at home, started to take shape - they set up the front bedroom with a hospital bed and nurses would visit us every day to check on the medications and the pain driver. Care was mostly in the hands of mum and Ranjeny and me, which felt good, cause that's the kind of thing we do, is look after people.

### Assessment of symptoms

Information in palliative care must be gathered from a range of sources:
* Conversation with the person and family
* Physical exam and clinical ix
* Observation - how they respond to treatment, changes in person's QOL, how treatment affects the overall/holistic condition of the person.

Clinical assessment
* Symptom characterisation: intensity, location, quality, temporal nature, frequency, pattern of disability
* Contributing factors: different causal mechanisms can require diff mx responses
* Behavioural responses: actions the person is taking to manage or cope with the sx
* Meaning of the sx to the person, beliefs about the symptom, its effect on physical/psych/social wellbeing

Assessment tools provide an objective view:
* RUG-ADL: 4 item scale. Measure motor function with ADLs, base assessment on what they do not what they are capable of doing.
  + Bed mobility, toileting, transfers out of 5; eating out of 3.
  + Score 4-10 --> monitor; score 10 or more consider equipment requirements, case/family conference, staff requirements, carer burden, referral.
* AKPS: single score between 10 and 100 __assigned by a clinician__ based on observations of ability to perform basic activity, work and self-care tasks.
  + Score 70-100 --> monitor
  + Score 60-70 --> consider referral, case/family conference
  + Score 20-60 --> consider equipment requirements, case/family conference, staff requirements, carer burden referral
  + Score 10-20 end of life care.
* SAS: rated by person w/ illness, rather than by clinician. Assess degree of distress relating to seven common symptoms.

### Symptom management

Management must take into account the wishes of the person and the goals they want to achieve.

Pain
- Opioids
- Adjuvant pain medication: tricyclics, duloxetine,

Fatigue

Gi symptoms

Respiratory symptoms

Sleeping problems

Psychological symptoms - anxiety, depression, delirium

## Spinal Cord Injury - Rehab

### Aetiology

Traumatic: __MVAs, falls, sports accidents, violence__
* In Victoria usually admitted to Alfred trauma unit or Austin, then CGMC or Royal Talbot for rehab

Non-traumatic: __tumours, abscesses, disc herniation, degenerative disease, bleeds.__
* Limited acceptance to Austin/Alfred, often non-specialised centres

Pre-existing pathology uncovered by trauma

### Classification of SCI

LEVEL + DEGREE OF IMPAIRMENT

Steps to classify:
1. Determine sensory level for L and R sides
2. Determine motor level
3. Determine the single level (most caudal segment where motor and sensory function are normal on both sides)
4. Is the injury complete (no voluntary anal contraction, S4-5 sensory scores = 0, nil anal sensation) or incomplete (sacral sparing)
5. Determine ASIA: complete impairment --> A, motor-complete --> B, motor grade < 3 in at least half below the level --> C (tendency not to walk), motor grade > 3 in at least half below the level --> D (tendency to walk), E = normal.

### Spinal shock in SCI

* Reduction or abolition of sensory, motor and reflex function below the level of injury
  + Often seen immediately after or within 24h
  + More common in compelete than incomplete injury
* __Flaccid paralysis__, areflexia, anaestheia, absent bowel and bladder control
* +/- priapism, bradycardia, hypotension (R- other causes)
  + Retention --> hydronephrosis is the worry => in the ED everyone with SCI should have IDC inserted
  + Stomach fluid build-up --> NGT for pressure relief
* May last up to __5 weeks__

### Bladder issues in SCI

Bladder issues
* Acute - always IDC
* __UMN__ bladder: reflexic, above conus medullaris/cauda equina (L1)
  + __Detrusor overactivity__ - reflexive bladder emptying (spasms, urgency, frequency, incontinence, reduced capacity)
  + Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia - when the bladder contracts the sphincter does not relax --> increased pressures, VUR
  + Often intermittend self-catheterisation (ISC), condom drainage, SPC if unable.
* __LMN__ bladder: lesion at or below L1 - areflexic, cauda equina or conus medullaris injuries
  + Flaccid bladder +/- flaccid sphincter (chronic retention with overflow incontinence, incomplete emptying)
  + Emptying options include straining (discouraged), ISC

Manageing bladder issues
* Bladder function difficult to predict
* Every patient with potential to avoid long-term IDC should have urodynamics
* Medications: increase bladder capacity, reduce intravesical pressures
  + Anticholinergics: __oxybutynin, tolterodine__
* Intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC): aim at <500mLs in men, <400mLs in women.

NORMAL PVR IN A YOUNG HEALTHY PERSON IS <5mLs

Urinary complications
* SPC/IDC: colonisation at all times except directly post-treatment
* UTI - colonisation vs infection
  + Pts with UTI + SCI will __not__ have the usual pain on urination, frequency, dysuria. They will still have fever, sweats, stridor.
  + __Noxious stimulus below the lesion__ in SCI specifically worsesns __spasticity, neuropathic pain, autonomic dysreflexia__.
  + Bloods: inflammatory markers. Cultures.
  + If treating, send off before/after CSU, send another 24h after ceasing ABx.
  + _Proteus mirabilis_ increases calculus formation
* Complications of neurogenic bladder
  + Chronic UTIs, bladder diverticulae, bladder stones, urethral trauma, bladder cancer (more common in people with SCI 15-20 years after the injury, regardless of IDC or not), VUR, hydronephrosis, PN, renal failure.
  + ==> Urology referral
  + ==> Consider repeat urodynamics in intermittent bladder emptying. Consider cystoscopy

Annual/biannual monitoring
* The majority of patients with SCI should see a spinal consultant on an annual or biannual basis
* Pre-review tests in Vic are KUB xr, renal US, CUE at a minimum
* Aim is to ID renal and other problems and prevent deterioration

### Bowel management

Reflexic (above conus L1/L2) --> hyperreflexic pelvic mm., inability to relax sphincter --> constipation
* Basic management of the reflexic spinal bowel:
* Senokot 2 tablets at night (stimulant, 12h duration), Coloxyl (softener) tds
* Place pt on commode after breakfast +/- suppository aiming at a single continent bowel action
* Hope remain continent for 24h until next day
* Some need an enema

Areflexic (below L1/L2) --> slower transit, reduced sphincter tone --> constipation with frequent incontinence
* Mx is mostly same as reflexic bowel
* Advise whenever close to a bathroom, sit on toilet and strain a little

With training and management, most patients do achieve continence.

Last resort = ileostomy/colostomy. "You must understand, if I refer patients for a stoma, it is a failure of my management"

### Spasticity

Rate-related increase in muscle tone.
* Generalised more common than focal
* Non-pharmacological Mx: positioning, stretching program, serial casting
  + Teach patients and carers how to position the joints properly
  + Take joints through full ROM a few times a day
* Pharmacological Mx: focal (botox injections) not used often.
  + Baclofen is fist
  + Diazepam is second, very low doses
* Exacerbation? Something going wrong below the lesion --> look for a cause

### Autonomic dysreflexia

* Manifestation of ANS dysfunction unique to SCI
  + Lesions at T6 or above
  + __Exaggerated sympathetic response to a noxious stimulus occurring below the lesion__
  + Cause = lack of descending supraspinal inhibitory control
  + Much more common in complete than incomplete
* Noxious stimuli: __sitting on/blocking catheter__, UTI, __detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia__, bowel distension, kidney stones, bowel impaction, #, heterotopic bone, surgery, pressure sore, reproductive system
* Presentation: __pounding headache__, HTN 20-40 mmHg above baseline (_normally this population will have a low baseline SBP 100-120_ --> be worried even if BP is 150), flushing and sweating above the lesion +/- nasal congestion, blurred vision, anxiety (sensation of impending doom)
  + Skin pallor, piloerection below the lesion
* Management: __THIS IS AN EMERGENCY__. Need two people to control the situation. Non-drug mangement first.
  + Sit upright and elevate head of bed. Loosen clothes, remove compression stockings and abdominal binder.
  + If they have IDC or SPC: empty leg bag and estimate volume. Consider fluid balance.
  + Checking the catheter: kinks, blocks, valves. If it is blocked, GENTLY IRRIGATE w 30mLs sterile water. Drain bladder slowly (500mL init, 250mL each 15min after). If unsuccessful, recatheterise.
  + If BP falls after bladder is emptied, keep them under close obs.
  + No catheter: insert one. Check the rectum for faecal loading. If rectum is full check BP before manual evacuation.
* Drugs: GTN anginine SL OR 5mg transdermal patch. If on viagra give nifedipine 10mg SL instead.
* Low threshold for referral to ED/ICU/spinal unit

### Skin care

* SCI patients have neither awareness they need to relieve pressure on the skin nor capacity to do so.
* Concern areas sacral & wherever pt in contact with wound shield: sides of hips, lateral malleoli, back of skull from ICU.
* Risk ischemia and necrosis: muscle very sensitive - skin pressure area on skin may be small but covering ++ muscle necrosis
* Scalds, burns, grazes, shear stresses. Older --> fragile skin.
* BD skin checks with a mirror
* Pressure relief: big ask; usually pressure relief will significantly impair ADLs and social/work life.
* Medical mx, surgical mx (if surgery required they will need full pressure relief post-op)

### Pain

* __Nociceptive pain__: bone, joint, tissue trauma; spine instability; muscle spasm; overuse pain or pressure syndromes; visceral pain.
* __Neuropathic/neurologic pain__: usu a band of pain at the level + neuropathic pain below the level of injury. Worse w noxious stimuli.

Management
* Often dealing with chornic pain
* Nociceptive: mx per non-SCI patients.
  + Rotator cuff problems common in wheelchair users. Physio and OT technique review essential.
* Neuropathic/neurologic: can be very difficult to treat. Amitriptyline 1st, pregabalin 2nd, gabapentin. Other TCAs, other anticonvulsants (carbemazepine)

### Respiratory function

* Respiratory disorders a leading cause of death in patients with SCI (acute and chronic settings)
* Respiratory muscle weakness, aspiration, clearing secretings
* High quad likely to need ICU in matter of hours
* Pneumonia in 50% quadriplegics
* Secretion mobilisation techniques

### Discharge planning/life after hospitalisation

* First consideration: can we get this person home and how?
* Various wheelchairs: basic heavy wheelchair $500, light manouverable chair $3000, power wheelchair $9000
* Sources of __funding__: TAC, WorkCover authority, NDIS, DHS aids and equipment program, DVA


## Stroke

* 50 000 strokes per annum in Aus
* 50% of those are in over 75s.
* 85% of survivors live w a disability

Types:
* Infarct (85%) - small vessel vs large vessel, thrombotic vs embolic.
* Haemorrhagic (15%) - HTN 1st, amyloid 2nd, AV malformation 3rd, coagulopathy, aneurysm, drugs.

Prognosis (mortality, function, recurrence):
* Infarct: 1/5 die in a month, 1/3 die in a year, 1/2 die in 5 years. Highest risk early on.
* Haemorrahgic: 1.5x mortality cf infarcts, more severe functional impairment, less predictable outcomes.
* Indicators for mortality: unconscious stroke, dysphagia, urinary incontinence, hyperthermia, IHD, PVD, DM
* Indicators for function: less social support, precarious premorbid function, low function on admision (FIM score), age, comorbid CCF/DM, prolonged flaccidity, poor sitting balance, neglect, visuospatial impairment, incontinence, impaired cognition, low motivation, delayed rehab.
* Recurrence: 2-4% in first month. Risk greater for cortical vs lacunar infarct.  10-16% in 1st year, 30% at 5 years.

### Stroke syndromes

The impact depends on location in brain and size of stroke.
* Lacunar, TACI (worst in terms of both survival and recovery), PACI, POCI.

Total anterior circulation stroke
* Involves an entire hemisphere of the brain.
* Dense hemiparesis. Dense hemisensory loss. Hemianopia. Cortical dysfunction: speech. Language disturbance if dominant. Neglect if nondominant.
* Brain swelling: sometimes neurosurgery will remove a panel of skull to release the pressure.
* Prognosis: high mortality, low recurrence rate, poor prognosis for recovery (5% return to independent living)

Partial anterior ciruclation stroke
* 2 or 3 of TACI or cortical dysfunction alone
* Prognosis: low mortality high recurrence in short term. Good prognosis. >50% to independent living.

Posterior circulation syndrome
* brainstem symptoms and signs; diverse and many specific syndromes within
* Prognosis: high mortality in short, low recurrence, good prognosis if survive acute, >60% IL
  + May look pretty dire on admission but cognition & language usually intact; much potential for rehab & learning

Lacunar syndrome
* Often pick off a specific motor or sensory pathway. Hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, nil cortical dysfunction.
* Anatomy: small deep lesion in corona radiata internal capsule.
* Prognosis: V low mortality, high recurrence in long term, good prgnosis, >85% IL

### Brainstem rules of 4

Brainstem blood supply
1. Paramedian branches of the basilar
2. Long circumferential branches of the basilar: the SCA, AICA and PICA.

Occlusion of these two groups of vessels results in distinct brainstem syndromes:
1. __Medial/paramedian brainstem syndromes__ due to paramedian branch occlusion
2. __Lateral brainstem syndromes__ due to occlusion of circumferential branches

Four rules of four:
1. 4 structures in the midline beginning with M
2. 4 lateral (side) structures beginning with S
3. 4 CNs in the medulla, 4 in the pons and 4 above the pons (2 midbrain, 2 cortical).
4. 4 motor nuclei in the midline are _divisors of 12_ - i.e. 3, 4, 6, 12 (5, 7, 9, 11 are motor and lateral)

The __4 medial structures__ and associacted deficits are:
1. __Motor pathway/Corticospinal tract (CST)__: contralateral weakness of arm and leg.
2. __Medial lemniscus__: contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception in the arm and leg.
3. __Medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)__: midbrain and pons. Ipsilateral inter-nuclar ophthalmoplegia (failure of adduction of the ipsilateral eye towards the nose, nystagmus in the contra eye as it looks laterally)
4. __4 motor nuclei and nerve__: ipsilateral loss of the affected cranial nerve 3/4/6/12

The __4 side (lateral) structures__ are:
1. __Spinocerebellar pathway__: ipsilateral arm and leg ataxia
2. __Spinothalamic pathway (STT)__: contralateral pain and temperature sense changes in arm, leg, sometimes trunk.
3. __Sensory nucleus of CN 5__ (this nucleus is a long vertical structure extending in the lateral aspect of the pons into the medulla): ipsilateral alteration pain and temperature sense on the face in distribution of CN 5
4. __Sympathetic pathway__: ipsilateral Horner syndrome - partial ptosis, small pupil, anhidrosis.

Four CNs above the pons are CN 1-4:
1. Olfactory (CN1): forebrain.
2. Optic (CN2): LGN (relay to visual cortex) and pretectal area.
3. Oculomotor (CN3): midbrain. Impaired adduction, supradduction and infradduction of the ipsilateral eye +/- a dilated pupil. "Down and out pupil".
4. Trochlear (CN4): eye unable to look down when eye looking in towards the nose (SO muscle).
CN 3 and 4 are the motor nerves in the midbrain.

Four CNs in the pons are CN 5-8:
5. Trigeminal (CN5): ipsilateral alteration of pain, temperature, light touch on the face back to the anterior 2/3 of the scalp and sparing the angle of the jaw.
6. Abducens (CN6): ipsilateral weakness of lateral eye movement (LR muscle)
7. Facial (CN7): ipsilateral facial weakness.
8. Auditory (CN8): ipsilateral deafness. N&V, vertigo common with involvement of vestibular connections in the lateral medulla.
CN6 is the motor nerve in the medial pons. CN7 is motor but also carries pathways of taste, and is in the lateral pons. The vestibular portion of CN8 is technically motor but confusing.

Four CNs in the medulla are CN 9-12:
9. Glossopharyngeal (CN9): ipsilateral loss of pharyngeal sensation.
10. Vagus (CN10): ipsilateral palatal weakness.
11. Spinal accessory (CN11): ipsilateral weakness of the trapezius and SCM mm.
12. Hypoglossal (CN12): ipsilateral weakness of the tongue.
CN12 is the motor nerve in the midline of the medulla. CN9, 10, 11 have motor components and are lateral.

_If there are signs of both a lateral and medial brainstem syndrome, consider a basilar artery problem._

### Ix and Mx

CODE STROKE --> BYPASS THE ED straight to CT and clot retrieval or thrombolysis.

For everyone:
* FBE, UEC, ESR, lipid profile, glucose
* ECG/holter monitor
* CT
* Carotid US
* MRI with DWI
* TTE (source of emboli)

Young with no obvious RFs:
* Vasculitic screen
* Thrombophilic screen
* Syphillis serology
* TOE (septal defects)

Acute mx:
* Intensive BP lowering to below 140 is not recommended. BP may be reduced to around 140 in pts with ICH.
* Ischaemic stroke: aim for <185/110 before thrombolyis Rx. Reduce BP over 220/120 by 20% in the first 24h.
* Aspirin: initial dose 150-300mg. Delay if thrombolysing.
* O2 if SpO2 < 95.

Secondary prevention long-term:
* Aspirin +/- dipyridamole or clopidogrel
* ACEi: perindopril. usu 2-4 days after stroke.
* Statin: always start.
* Anticoagulant: if AF. NOAC or warfarin. Start within 2/52.
* Carotid surgery if occlusion <70% on the affected side. Endarterectomies can cause strokes so avoid if occlusion is asymptomatic.

SNAP: smoking, nutrition, alcohol, physical activity.

### Rehabilitation

ICF rehab framework: impairment (body structure and function) <--> activity <--> participation; environmental and personal factors.
* Treat the condition
* Secondary prevention
* Prevention of complications (pressure sores, contractures, hypostatic pneumonias, DVTs)
* Setting for rehab: mild 1/3 for OP or HB, middle-severity 1/3 suit IP rehab, most severe 1/3 potentially die before rehab.
* General objectives = recovery or compensation

Know specific stroke syndromes and how they each affect rehabilitation
* Apply principles of stroke rehab
* know and predict outcomes from strokes

Prognosis after stroke: knowledge helps us predict parts of the ICF framework
* Clinical presentation --> impairment
* Level of current funtion cf. time --> activity
* Personal and psychosocial factors --> participation

Under the ICF framework -
* Impairment:
  + Weakness
  + Loss of sensation
  + Loss of cardiorespiratory fitness
  + Visual field loss
* Activity/functional status:
  + Crossed leg in acute setting
  + Shoulder shrug 2/52 after stroke likely to lead to recovery of hand function
  + SAFE sign: people who can shoulder abduct and finger extend after 2/52 (Kwakkel et al) are good candidates for heavy rehab
  + Sitting balance a good sign.
  + Practice reaching beyond arms length while sitting.
  + Negative prognostic signs: visuospatial deficits (neglect, inattention, dysgnosia); stroke-related cognitive deficits (attentional deficits in early stage, executive and new learning later); comorbidities (CVD, respiratory, severe arthritis, continence)
  + Also standing from sitting, walking, arm activity
* Participation
  + pADLs: showering, toileting, dressing, eating
  + dADLs, cADLs: home maintenance, management of finances, community access, driving
  + Targeting sensorimotor impairments & physical activity all impact on ADLs.
  + Specific and task-focussed therapy & consideration of appropriate aids for each of these areas

## Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) = insult to the brain caused by an external physical force

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) = tearing and shearing of microscopic brain cells

Acquired brain injury (ABI) = insult to the brain occurring after birth - includes TBI, stroke, near suffocation, infection, anoxia, EtOH

### Gross brain anatomy r/v

Base of the skull is rough with many bony protuberances - these can result in injury to temporal and frontal lobes during rapid accel/deceleration.
* Bony ridges --> frontal lobes really cop it

Frontal lobe
* Executive - problems solving, spontaneity, memory, language, motivation ,judgeement, impulse control, social and sexual.
* Social and group cooperation functions - solitary species do not have need of a frontal lobe
* Prefrontal cortex most anterior part - intellect, complex learning, personality

Temporal lobe
* Emotions
* Smelling, tasting, perception
* Memory, understanding music, aggressiveness, sexual behaviour
* Language areas

Parietal lobe
* Subconscious integration
* Where sensations (touch, smell, taste) become lived experiences?
* Spatial awareness, hand-eye coordination, arm movement.
* Wernicke language area - match words with the sounds of spoken speech.

Limbic system
* Regulate emotion and memory
* Connect lower and higher brain function

Occipital lobe
* Controls vision and recognition
* 30% of what you see thru your eyes goes towards seeing a complete picture?

### Epidemiology and aetiology

TBI Epidemiology
* MVA, cycling accidents, falls, assaults, sporting injuries
* Incidence in range from 100-200/100,000 pa
* 80% are mild, 20% moderate to severe
* 2-3 are male for every female
* More than 2/3 occur in aged < 30. Peak in age 15-24. Second peak in the elderly.
* More common in those with psychopathology, substance abuse, poor academic record, unemployment??

Pathophysiology
* Blunt trauma assoc. acceleration/decelaration --> combination of translation and rotation of brain in skull
* Scalp laceration, skull fracture, shifting of intracranial contents.

### Types of TBI

Primary TBI = injury at the moment of impact as a direct result of trauma to the head.
* ICH: subdural haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, epidural haemorrhage
* Cerebral contusion
* Cerebral laceration
* Axonal stretch injury

Secondary TBI = injury as a result of systemic complications, potentially treatable.
* Cerebral oedema
* Altered cerebral blood flow and oxygenation
* Impaired metabolism
* Free radical formation
* Excitotoxicity

Diffuse axonal injury
* Rapid accel-decel moves some parts of the brain separately from other parts --> shear forces destroy axons & stretch nerve bundles of the brain

Coup-contracoup injury
* Bruises at the site of impact where the brain is struck, and on the opposite side of the brain as it rebounds back against that wall.

### Imaging

* No neuroimaging techniques work particularly well
* CT will detect intracranial haematoma, large contuion, cerebral abscess, ventricular enlargement, cerebral atrophy. BUT scan on the day of injury will not show full extent.
* MRI sensitive to non-haemorrhagic grey & white matter lesions BUT still not to microscopic lesions.

### Severity of TBI

Post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) = period of time after injury where person is unable to lay down new memories. No reliable day to day memeory.
* Length of PTA is related to amount of DAI --> use to classify severity
* <5 minutes - very mild
* 5-60 minutes - mild
* 1-24 hours - moderate
* 1-7 days - severe
* 1-4 weeks - very severe
* >4 weeks - extreme

Distribution of severity of TBI:
* 80% are mild injuries: LOC < 30 min and PTA < 1 hour
* 10-13% are moderate: LOC 30 min-24h, PTA 1-24h
* 7-10% are severe: LOC > 24 hours, PTA > 24h.

### Consequences of TBI

Medical complications:
* Spasticity (hypotonia syndrome)
* Seizures: __post-traumatic epilepsy__. Overall rate 5% inc w/ severity of TBI. Increaesd risk with depressed skull fracture, early seizure, intracranial haematoma > 2cm, prolonged PTA, focal injury.
* Heterotopic ossification: bone formation in nonosseous tissues, including muscles, connective tissues. Pro-inflammatory process presents like gout around/near joints.
* Hydrocephalus
* SIADH/diabetes insipidus - damage to pituitary.
* Mental health

Possible __neuro symptoms__: often both hemispheres of the brain are unpredictably affected.
* Motor skills/balance
* Hearing
* Vision
* Speech
* Fatigue/weakness
* Taste/smell

Cognitive & behavioural cx of frontal lobe injury:
* Post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) - measure of severity.
* __Orbitofrontal__ (shearing around the cribriform plate): disinhibition, self-centred, fatuous humour, agitated and aggressive behaviour.
* __Medial frontal__: decreased initiative, spontaneity and motivation.
* __Dorsolateral frontal__: decreased planning, judgement, insight, abstract thought processes, thought rigidity, perseveration.
* Deficits in __executive function__ doesn't always look like an inability to plan/organise - also:
  + Uncooperative/stubborn
  + Lack of follow-through
  + Irresponsibility
* __Personality and behavioural__ changes:
  + Depression
  + Social skills
  + Mood swings
  + Disinhibition
  + Initiation problems/avolition
  + Low self-esteem
  + Difficulty relating to others, maintaining relationships, forming new relationships
  + Stress/anxiety/frustration, reduced frustration tolerance
* __Unawareness__ might look like:
  + Insensitivity, rudeness
  + Overconfidence
  + Unconcerned about extent of problems
  + doesn't believe needs supports
  + Covering up problems
  + Difference between what they think and others think of their behaviour
  + Blaming others for problems, making excuses
* __Attention__ deficit
  + Changing subject, not completing tasks
  + Trouble doing two or more things at once
* __Memory__ deficit
  + missing appointments, not completing tasks
  + Perseveration
  + Confabulation to cover up
* __Fatigue__: brain function becomes less efficient and takes up more energy.


### Rehabilitation considerations

Cognitive and neuropsych assessment
* Mental status assessment:
  + MMSE - can score well on these with quite severe TBI.
  + A good mental status test for frontal lobe function is to go shopping with someone and assess how they respond in the supermarket environemnt.
* Neuropsychological assessment: cognitive rather than the emotional inteligence. Done as soon as PTA resolves as baseline, re-do in 6-12 months time.

Lifestyle: vocation, personal relations, age-appropriate activities, independence, family supports

Behavioural control
* The mainstay is environmental management - private rooms, specialised nursing staff, minimise agitation
* Minimise use of meds negatively affecting cognition
* Consider medications:
  + Carbamazepine, beta blocker
  + Risperidone, haloperidol
  + Methylphenidate, Lithium

Post-concussive syndrome, PTSD - major concern in people with milder TBI.
* Startle response increased
* irritability
* Avoid social events and new situations

## Urinary Incontinence

Inontinence = complaint of __any involuntary leakage of urine__
* In women rise with age then levelling age 50-65, then rise after 65

Misconception that leakge is an unavoidable part of aging or that no treatments are available.
* Minority of GPs ask about it
* People feel sad and awkward about this
* Major impact on QOL - severity does not necessarily correlate to bother.

Many pts self-manage: voiding frequently, avoid fluid intake, wearing pads, reduce socialising.

Complications: UTIs, incontience-associated dermatitis, skin ulceration, falls (rushing to toilet or slipping on incontinence), sleep disturbance (waking at night to toilet), social isolation, contributes to putting people in nursing homes.

### Lower Urinary Physiology

Storage (99% of the time): low-pressure, highly compliant bladder body; relaxed detrusor muscles.
* Lumbar sympathetic nerves for relaxing the bladder body and contracting the bladder base and urethra.
* Pudendal nerves contract the external ureteral sphincter.

Pontine micturition centre decides to flick into

V
Voiding: initiated voluntarily; external sphincter and bladder neck relax and detrusor contracts. Locally controlled ANS pathway: Pelvic parasympathetic nerves exiting S2S4 spinal cord then meet the bladder with M3 receptors (acetylcholine).

Pelvic floor anatomy is complex. Often there is a degree of muscle stretching asymetrically after delivering a baby.

### Factors contributing to urinary frequency

* Diabetes: poor autonomic function
* IHD: nocturia as peripheral oedema returns to vessels when lying flat.
* Fucntional incontinence: post-stroke, degenerative joint disease prevent getting to toilet in time
* ?UTI
* Overactive bladder syndrome
* COPD cough can contribute to stress incontinence
* Sleep apnea assoc. w nocturia via neuroendocrine pathways.
* Stroke and parkinsons linked with OAB (brain reorganising), plus functional overlay
* Dementia
* Pelvic organ crosstalk - treat bladder and bowel simultaneously

Medications contributing:
* Alpha adrenergic meds
* CCBs
* Cholinesterase inhibitors
* Diuretics
* SGLT2 inhibitors increase risk UTIs

### Symptom categorisations

__Storage__ symtoms: urinary frequency (>8 voids during the day), nocturia (waking at night), urgency (bladder sensation they absolutely must go), polyuria, sensory sx
* Storage sx syndrome = __overactive bladder syndrome (OAB)__
* Ask: how often, triggers, deferment time, volume?

__Voiding__ symtoms: hesitancy, straining to void, slow intermittent stream, terminal dribble, position dependent voiding, dysuria, haematuria, urinary retention. Think prostate.
* Voiding syndrome = __bladder outlet obstruction__

Post-void sx:

### Diagnoses

1) __Stress incontinence__: postpartum stretching/tearing of the pelvic floor muscles. Mx = pelvic floor exercises.

2) __OAB__: overactive detrusor muscle
* Clinical triad of __urgency, frequency, nocturia (FUN)__ +/- incontiennce. 2/3 are dry, 1/3 are wet.
* Triggered by running water, strong urge to go.
* Look for a reason the detrusor is overactive: neurogenic, idiopathic, obstructive. Detrusor overactivity is a urodynamic diagnosis.
* DDx: increased bladder sensitivity (__bladder tumour__ or stone sensitising the afferent nerve terminals); incomplete empyting from detrusor underactivity; stress incontence presenting as urgency

3) __Bladder outlet obstruction__: prostate, bladder neck, ureteral stenosis

4) Potentially overlying the previous three is some degree of __functional incotienence__

5) __Continuous incontinence__ --> concern for underlying fistula

6) Transient (reversible) incontinence: DIPPERS
* Delirium
* infection
* Pharmaceuticals
* Psychological - depression and cognitive impairment
* Excess UO
* Reduced mobility - functional factors
* Stool impaction causing bladder outlet obstruction

### Assessmnet

Salient points on history: medications, obs and gynae hx, sexual history, LUTS, bowel history
* Severity of incontinence (how many pads, leaking onto your clothes or your bed linen).
* Functional or social or psychological impact (score bother out of 10). Fluid intake, caffeine, alcohol.
* "Oliguria" considered less than 400 mL in 24h.

Elderly: cognition, mobility, falls, function, social history.

Bladder scan: pre- and post-void. PVR < 50 mL is adequate, > 200 inadequte emptying.

Ix:
* UEC + CMP: renal function, Ca levels
* Diabetic control
* Renal tract US

More invasive testing:
* Urodynamic testing
* Measure detrusor pressure and over/under-activity.

Bladder diary:
* Fluid intake
* Urine Output

### Management

Initial goal is __independent contience__. _If this is unrealistic_, aim for either dependent continence (dry with toileting, assistance, Rx &/or meds.), or contained incontinence (contain urine with pads or appliances).

First, non-pharmacological. Lifestyle, behaviour, functional training, improve safety, continence aids. Optimise DM and CCF.
* Strengthen the pelvic floor - most important for stress IC

Medications for urge IC
* 2nd line: oral agents antimuscarinics
* 3rd line:

Consider referral to urogynae surgery for stress IC

## Wound care

Chronic wounds are more common in the elderly: comorbidities + age-related changes (increased inflammation, delayed epithelial formation)

### Pressure injuries

* Risk factors: extrinsic (pressure, shear, friction) and intrinsic (age, urinary incontinence, immobility, neurological disease, malnutrition, severe illness).
* Staging: important to know.
  + Stage I intact skin with unblanching redness.
  + Stage II partial thickness dermis loss; shallow ulcer/blister.
  + Stage III full thickness tissue loss, SC fat visible, no bone, muscle or tendon.
  + Stage IV: full thickness tissue loss w/ exposed bone, muscle, tendon.
* Best Mx is preventative: pressure-relieving mattresses have the most evidence.

### Ulcers

Commonest cause of foot ulcers: diabetes
Leg ulcers: venous disease

Venous ulceration
* 2/3 of leg ulcers (commonest cause of knee-to-ankle ulcers)
* Result of venous hypertension
* Often recurrent
* Superficial or deep venous disease
* Risk factors: varicose veins, DVT, CVI, obesity, poor calf muscle function, AV fistulae, Hx leg #
* Mx = __compression__. Recurrence prevention 18-24 mmHg, chronic oedema and large heave legs 25-35 mmHg.
  + Contraindication to compression: arterial disease

Arterial disease
* Foot pulses
* Normal ankle-brachial index (ABI) = 1.0
  + ABI 0.5-0.9 mild to moderate arterial disease; 0.3-0.5 severe arterial disease, <0.3 critical limb ischaemia.
* Toe pressure = absolute SBP of the digital arteries. Normal > 80 mmHg. CLI < 30 mmHg.

### Infected wounds

It can be hard to tell whether a chronic wound is infected.
* All chronic wounds are contaminated/colonised by bacteria
* Colonisation --> critical colonisation --> biofilm --> infection

Critical colonisation: NERDS. Non-healing, exudative, red & bleeding, debris, smell.
* Debridement and topical antimicrobials

Deep infection: STONES. Size of wound increased, temperature high, Os (exposed bone), new area breakdown, erythema/exudate, smell.
* Debridement and systemic antimicrobials

Swab after you clean but before you administer ABx.
