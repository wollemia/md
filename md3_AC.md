## Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment

Extras cf. long case: explicit collateral history from family, explicit cognitive testing; explicit inclusion of nursing and allied health assessments

* Restate common geriatric syndromes
* Understand rationale and purpose of CGA
* Key components of CGA and assessment tools
* ID role of allied health
* Key sources of info for a CGA
* Describe differences in examination for people with CI
* How chronic diseases impact patients' lives

### Geriatric syndromes

* Instability
* Immobility
* Incontience
* Intellectual declines:
* Iatrogenesis
* Functional decline
* Pressure ulcers
* Dizziness

__Frailty__ (Fried's criteria) = unintentional weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slow walking speed, low physical activity
* Pre-frail: 1-2 criteria
* Frail: >= 3 criteria

### CGA process

1. Targeting appropriate patients

Some are too sick to benefit (long-term needs are not influenced by a CGA); others are too well to benefit (outcomes are not influenced by a CGA).

Appropriate for CGA:
* __Recent onset__ physical or cognitive impairment
* Changing physical and/or cognitive status
* Multiple __interacting problems amenable to treatment__
* __Fragmented__ specialty medical care
* Disorders __requiring rehabilitation__ therapy
* Consideration of __change in living situation__
* Evaluating competency/capacity
* Dealing with medico-legal issues

2. (a) Assessing

Collecting information from 4 sources: (1) self-reported; (2) collateral history; (3) direct observation of function; (4) medical records & MDT input
* Members of the __MDT__: hospital medical, GP, nursing, physiotherapy, OT, social work, neuro/clinical psychology, podiatry, speech pathology, dietetics
* __Self-reporting may be compromised__: acute illness, impaired cognition, impaired communication (TLC, deafness, english proficiency), depression, fear of consequences, rationalisation, cultural issues
* Emotional language to describe functionality:
  + Spectrum from less independent to more independent
  + Frail, exhausted, ready to die
  + Not coping, losing control, vulnerable
  + Struggling, frustrating, difficult
  + Slowing down, feeling tired
  + "Good" for my age
* Collateral from: family, carers, GP. Not always accurate; based on observed performance; limited by discomfort/embarrassment, health literacy, awareness of or exposure to current status
* Direct observation: usually by allied health. Best for assessing physical function. More accurate than self report or collateral history.
  + __Capacity vs performance__: what they can do, rather than what they actually do.
  + Reasons for under-performance: unwell/fatigue, afraid, lack of need, lack of suitable aids or modifications, executive dysfunction.

Medical assessment
* Problem list including comorbidities and disease severity
* Medication review
* Nutrition, dentition

Functional assessment
* ADLs: personal, domestic, community; functional independence measure (FIM); Barthel's
* Balance and gait: Timed Up and Go (TUG); Sternal push/Pastor test
* Continence: continence charts; bladder diary; urodynamics  

Neuropsychological
* Cognition: 4AT (assessment test for delirium and cognitive impairment); sMMSE (dementia); MoCA; FAB (frontal assessment battery)
* Mood: geriatric depression scale (GDS)

Social
* Living arrangements
* Supports (formal, informal)

Environmental
* Home safety
* Transport/community access

Beliefs and values
* Religion/spirituality
* Sexuality/intimacy
* End of life care

Challenges:
* Atypical presentation of disease
* Lack of sensitivity and specificity of investigations
* Goals of care
* Agism/nihilism from health professionals, family, carers, patients

2. (b) Developing recommendations



3. Implementing recommendations



## Cognitive assessment

Diagnosis <--> treatment <--> prognosis

* Safety concerns: medication management, driving
* Future planning

DDx for cognitive impairment
* Dementia: CI impacting function. Prevalence doubles every 5 years between the age of 68 and 90. AD, FTD, VD. Common to have more than 1 cause.
* Delirium: acute onset confusional state w/ fluctuating course.
* Focal brain lesions w/ specific neurological & cognitive deficits.

### History taking

* Timeline
* Memory: events/names, appointments/plans, losing things, repeated conversations, unable to learn new skills
* Visuospatial: orientation, getting lost, driving
* Reasoning, judgement, problems solving: unable to cope with unexpected events, easily overwhelmed
* Language: word-finding, mixing languages
* Complex tasks: meds, finances
* Previously well-known household tasks: cooking, woodworking, sewing
* Personality or behavioural changes: sundowning, wandering, self-care, sleep
* Neuropsychiatric: mood changes, irritability, agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, delusions

IQ Code: ask an informant, compared to 10 years ago, how is this person's...

Risk factors on history:
* Vascular: stroke, TIA, hypertension, DM, lipids, IHD, AF, PVD, smoking
* General anaesthetic
* Head trauma
* DOA
* Malignancy
* Family history: dementia, vascular disease
* Neurodegenerative: anosmia, REM sleep behaviour disorder
* OSA

Medications:
* Benzos
* Anticholinergics
* Analgesics

Social history and others:
* Personal history: birth, schooling, language, occupations, relationships, retirement
* Driving; problems, distances, accidents, family concerns, limitations
* Finances
* Will, EPOA, ACD, ACAS

### Examination

General obs

Parkinsonism

Neurological exam: lateralising signs previous stroke

Vision

Cortical signs: graphaesthesia, dyscalculia, finger agnosia, LR disorientation

Primitive reflexes

AD exam generally normal

CVD exam

ECG for treatment purposes

### Tools

MoCA

Stroop colour words test

## Dementia

2nd leading cause of mortality & 1st in Women
* 1st cause of mortality in >65 yos

Normal ageing:
* Slower __thought processes and reaction times__: particularly affects working memory, while sustained attention - vigilance - is preserved
* Reduced efficiency __retrieving memories__: episodic memory affected while semantic memory preserved.
* Occasional word finding difficulties
* May rely on prior knowledge, experience and expert opinion to make decisions

vs

Dementia (DSM-V): evidence of __significant cognitive decline__ from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains (__learning and memory, language, executive function, complex attention, perceptual-motor, social cognition__)
* Cognitive deficits interfere with everyday activities (ADLs eg paying bills, managing medication)
* Not exclusively in the context of a delirium
* Not better explained by another mental disorder

vs

MCI: mild neurocognitive disorder with subjective memory complaints __without interfering with ADLs__
* 10% risk per year of progressing to dementia

Risk factors:
* Early life: less education
* Mid life: hypertension, obesity, hearing loss, diabetes
* Late life: smoking, depression, physical and cognitive inactivity

Aetiology:
* Alzheimer's disease
* VaD
* Lewy body
* FTD
* Mixed AD and VaD

Other DDx:
* Vitamin deficiency states: Vit B12, Vit B1 (thiamine: Wernicke --> Korsakoff)
* Neurological/neurodegenerative
  + Parkinson's
  + Normal pressure hydrocephalus
  + HTD
  + Head injury
  + SOL
  + MS
* CNS infections: tertiary syphilis, viral encephalitis, HAND (HIV-associated), Prion
* Chronic EtOH excess
* Metabolic: diabetes, thyroid disease, parathyroid disease, Cushing disease, Addison's disease

### Alzheimer's disease

Memory impairment early --> executive dysfunction and visuospatial impairment follow. Later, language and behavioural symptoms.
* __Early-onset AD__ is autosomal dominant, where half the family get AD before age 50.

### Vascular dementia

VaD is a spectrum from a single stroke thru to multiple small infarcts or multiple large strokes.
* Frontal lobe dysfunction earlier and memory impairment later
* Gait impairment and neurological sequelae
* CADISIL is an important cause of stroke in the young

### Lewy Bodies

Lewy bodies = eosinophilic introcytoplasmic inclusions in deep brain matter containing alpha synuclein
* Fluctuating cognition and visuospatial first, memory later
* Visual hallucinations?
* Parkinsonism occurs within 12 months of dememntia or prior, cf. PD dementia occurs 8-10 years after the movement disorder
* Sensitive to neuroleptic medications

### Frontotemporal dementia

Affects a younger age group. 3 variants = behavioural, non-fluent primary progressive aphasia, semantic primary progressive aphasia.
* Associated with some forms of motor neuron disease

## Falls

You want to characterise why someone fell, and what puts them at risk of falling again.
* History of falls
* Medications: worst are benzodiazepines, SSRIs, sedatives and hypnotics. Polypharmacy also bad. Check BP and doses of  antihypertensives.
* Gait and balance
* Cognition
* Lower limb joint function
* Neurological impairment
* Muscle strength
* HR and rhythm
* Postural hypotention
* Feet and footwear
* Environmental hazards

If head trauma, neurology, anticoagulation, consider CT brain.



### Gait disturbances

Break into low-level, mid level and high level gait disorders.



## Legal Aspects of ageing

Ageing ~ incidence of medical conditions affecting someone's ability to make decisions about financial, medical and lifestyle matters.
