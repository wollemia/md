## Postgrad Med Study Notes

Wollemia is a genus of coniferous trees in the family Araucariaceae known only through fossil records until 1994, when the species Wollemia nobilis was discovered in a temperate rainforest wilderness area growing in a remote series of narrow, steep-sided, sandstone gorges in Wollemi National Park, NSW, Australia. It has nothing to do with medicine at all but I like the story of the Wollemi pine very much, so it is the name under which they are hosted.
