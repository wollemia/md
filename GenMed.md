## Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE)

Autoimmune disease w/ tissue-binding autoAb and immune complexes.
* Usually autoAb predate clinical symptoms
* 90% of patients are women of childbearing age (but anyone is susceptible)

### Aetiology

Pathophysiology: __Immunogenic forms of nucleic acids/proteins/self-antigens__
* These bind to TLRs --> DCs produce IFNa; Mph produce IL12, TNFa and B cell maturation factor __BAFF__, Nph release nets, NK cells cannot kill auto-reactive T and B cells or produce TGFb
* Low threshold for T and B cells to auto-activate; fewer regulatory T cells
* Lupus phagocytes have reduced capacity to clear immune complexes, cells, phospholipid-containing surface blebs

Inflammation in target tissues --> release of vasoactive peptides, oxidative damage, growth factors, fibrosing factors
* Sclerosis/fibrosis with irreversible damage in multiple tissues

Genes w/ high hazard ratio:
* C1q, C2, C4 deficiency
* TREX1 mutation affecting DNA degradation

Genes for lupus nephritis:
* HLADR3, STAT4, APOL1, FCGR3A, ITGAM, IRF5, TNFSF4 (Ox40L), DNAse1

Environmental:
* UV light, smoking, crystalline silica
* ?EBV infection
* Female, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome)

### Multi-tissue manifestations

* __Renal__: __lupus nephritis__ - class III and IV treat aggressively to prevent ESRD (changes not yet irreversible)
  + Proteinuria in 100%, haematuria in 80%.
  + At the level of nephrotic range proteinuria, ACR:PCR usually 60-70%; if less, consider MM or MGUS.
* __Skin__: Lupus dermatitis (Ig deposition at the dermal epidermal junction)
  + Discoid lupus dermatitis most common chronic (roughly circular lesions with raised scaly hyperpigmented erythematous rims and depigmented atrophic centres).
  + Malar rash commonest acute.
  + Subacute cutaneous LE scaly red patches similar to psoriasis
* __Vessels__: MI, TIA, stroke increased in SLE and increased again with APLS.
  + Pathologically, leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Not specific but ~ active disease.
  + Brain ischaemia: bland focal occlusion or vasculitis or both (Rx = __anticoagulation or immunosuppression or both__)
  + MI = accelerated atherosclerosis. Statins reduce LDL and ?cardiac events
  + Libman-Sacks endocarditis --> fibrinoue vegetation embolisation.
* __Lungs__: pleuritis +/- pleural effusion
* LNs: diffuse chronic inflammation. Biopsy to R- malignancy.
* CNS: cognitive, headaches (more excruciating in a flare), reasoning, memory. Seizures. Psychosis must be distinguished from glucocorticoid-associated psychosis.
  + Myelopathy is not rare. Rapid initation immunosuppresion with high-dose glucocorticoids.
